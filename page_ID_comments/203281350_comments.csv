"1","NEGATIVE","Youth protection is apparently a new profession with a prospect of the future. 
Young people will always try to cross and question certain limits. A youth filter is absolutely ineffective, which almost everyone knows someone with an older sibling with access to all the information you want. It is more useful if parents spend a lot of time with the children.
In part, it is rather shameful what can be seen on TV between 18:00 and 22:00. Thus, sexual early education in kindergarten and school cannot start early enough. This is a double standard when WhatsApp suddenly calls for parental protection. Teenagers will seek sexual images, from a certain age. Often it starts very simply with animal videos. However, with WhatsApp, you suddenly need a control. 
A class chat is very easy to control, if the teachers click in, then there is no content that is not to be found there."
"2","NEGATIVE","I myself, through a Schuelerchat initiated by a Schuelerin from the heinrich-sigmund privatgymnasium in bw, received hate messages and devastation - anti-constitutional material. A musicians' chat became a vehicle for hate and incitement. I went to Kripo HD over a year ago. The schoolteacher showed and she flew from school after a reminder from the youth welfare office. However, the headmaster responded too late and showed me when I wanted to settle for trespassing. Very curios.Since the young people no longer have respect in intermediate and high school and good handling was not taught in school or in the net. Only with the fiftklaesslers there is still hope that they can take more with them in terms of media literacy. 14-17 years old are sometimes already messed up in bad manners. Grade on private high schools are poorly behaved. Teachers can no longer educate because of demand. Youth goes down the creek partially."
"3","NEUTRAL","All available online. It would be hoped for the current otherwise unanimous aspirations of exclusion as political-media outrages. There is only no demand for online-analytika and content-management."
"4","NEGATIVE","I don't want to be a child anymore. üòí"
"5","NEGATIVE","I graduated from school 11 years ago and there were already such discussions at that time. There were bullying victims, which were done over the Internet, accordingly Sch√ºlerVZ, MSN & ICQ, which is no longer used today. 

And now, after all this time, we're still talking about it, and the whole society pretends to not know what to do? 
For example, how long have video games been in place and how long is it known that they can be addictive and pose a risk especially for children and adolescents? It is known for a long time and it can be seen even to the most inclined parents that children are more likely to develop a gambling addiction than to use other drugs. 
Did something happen in this respect? No! No! 
There are still insufficient resources and infrastructure to assist children, young people, their parents or schools in these problems. 
We write the year 2019 and still children grow up without any structural role models, it's sad."
"6","NEGATIVE","I think the problem is not that children are watching and sharing things today. I find the problem there was already before the mobile phone and internet time. At the beginning of 1990, for example, I borrowed the N√ºrmberger Prozzese from the library at the age of 10. So you could look at such horrible pictures as a child. It was not necessary to believe the parents. Today it's only worse because the possibilities have improved. But the problem is old. A.F"
"7","NEGATIVE","If you borrow a book from the Bib, that's your personal problem. Whats app content can have hundreds of participants. The spreading goes much faster and essentially the content is taken over unreflective."
"8","POSITIVE","As the father of five children, four of whom have already grown up and the youngest is just a little puperting. Computers know our elders children still with black and white monitor, 5 1/4 inch floppies and 1 MB (!) Main memory for operating system, programs and data. After BTX, the first browsers used Netscape 2.0. Contrary to the recommendations made by ‚Äúexperts‚Äù only years later, we have left access completely open to all children without family filters or other restrictions. You could have viewed or downloaded everything on the Internet at any time. Our attitude was and still is: We trust you that you will not do everything you could do. You are responsible for what you click and look at. It is your soul that you ruin or not!
This concept has worked up to this day: the consistent abandonment of direct and indirect control enabled an atmosphere of trust, responsibility and voluntarily adhered to rules. Not a single failure in well over 25 years! Our children have access to everything, including bank accounts, through knowledge of passwords. 
What are we doing wrong?"
"9","POSITIVE","Thank you for your contribution.

No, you're not doing anything wrong. She and her family are apparently an association of reason. 
Unfortunately, many parents are apparently unable to live such an attitude themselves and thus continue to convey it to their children.
Our son doesn't have a filter on his phone either. However, we are in constant exchange with him about the content he looks at. At the moment, we have restricted his access to the phone because his behavior was too ‚Äúaddictive‚Äù. Meanwhile, he has swallowed the restriction, especially since he aims at a high school recommendation, and he understands that he can only spend his time once.
Let's see if we can leave his cell phone like this again soon. I hope that it ripens to such a extent that it limits its use by itself."
"10","NEUTRAL","With regard to the content mentioned in the article, the first question arises as to the empathy of children and adolescents."
"11","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúAt Tom's school, for example, says Tobias Knopp, responsible use of smartphones has not been a topic in class or project days.‚Äù
For parents, of course, school is to blame instead of grabbing their own noses"
"12","MIXED","A topic solidifies when it is addressed by several sides. Since your own child may have already learned this and gets porn in the first break. So the problem could be reduced if there were rules and information in school."
"13","NEUTRAL","The big bosses from the tech giants have already publicly stated that they would give their children a smartphone at the earliest at the age of 14 and then only temporarily. Why? Because they know exactly that the daily use of smartphones or tablets in young people has a negative impact on brain development. Highly recommended on the topic, Prof. Dr. Manfred Spitzer, Why make mobile phones stupid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLCOzpwuYE8&feature=emb_title"
"14","POSITIVE","@Ankica S.: Thanks for the valuable hint!"
"15","POSITIVE","I honestly find everything half as wild. Sure, no eight-year-old needs WhatsApp, but if 13/14-year-old teenagers send a couple of Hitler memes or porn jokes, what the hell? They're trying to provoke, and they're doing it for exactly that reason. Because it's ‚Äúedgy‚Äù.
Of course, this does not mean that you just give them a mobile phone and say ‚Äúdo it‚Äù, education is important, especially in relation to topics such as nude pictures, revenge pornography, etc. But here, my opinion is the parents in duty, not the schools.
Cyberbullying is also such a topic: Cyberbullying exists because children/teenagers want to bully someone and discover an additional ‚Äúchannel‚Äù. Without a mobile phone, there would be one dimension less in which the whole thing is going on, but the problem is not solved. Again, mainly the parents of the mobbing children are in duty. If they vehemently explain to the teachers that their little angel would never do something like that, the school can hardly do anything."
"16","NEGATIVE","‚Äú... send teenagers some Hitler memes or porn jokes, what the hell? ‚Äú
If my parents had known 35 years ago what we were playing on our first c64 for games, they would have confiscated the thing. ‚Äúconcentration camp simulator‚Äù, ‚ÄúRaid over Libyia‚Äù etc. Jewish jokes, brutality and porn were already there. Neither me nor one of my buddies from back then became a Nazi or a killer today. Kids do something like that. Just because it's forbidden."
"17","NEGATIVE","The children, who sometimes already have smartphones with the enrollment, are masterfully able to operate them, but they cannot cope with the contents. I am for my club and about acquaintances in dozens groups/chats etc.,... I am completely overwhelmed with √º40. Maybe I'm too old. Who knows. Although I don't get such crass stuff sent, but in part it is also borderline and I wonder what this is supposed to be. Children simply should not have such unfiltered and unsupervised access to the Internet. Even if this is difficult to implement."
"18","NEGATIVE","What is the school supposed to compensate for everything that is missed at home? Teaching a child decency, respect and morality is not the task of school but of parents. Therefore, today parents should regularly check children's computers and smartphones, geanuso as my parents used to check out which booklets we had hidden under the bed or elsewhere. This has nothing to do with lack of trust or unauthorized interference with the privacy of the children, but simply with the parents' parental education mission. What is it called so beautiful? ‚ÄúTrust is good, control is better‚Äù.

In a paper yesterday, Mrs Friedrichsen complained that the judiciary is lagging behind social developments, for which the problems presented here are a prime example. The age of 14 for the punishment of young people is simply no longer up-to-date at this point, as is the application of adult criminal law only from 21 years. As soon as the first ten-year-old spends his summer holidays in a prison instead of swimming pool or family holidays, this should also have a lasting impact on him or her and his/her school friends. 

And since most of the children's smartphones probably belong to their parents, or at least the corresponding mobile phone contract runs on their parents, it should be possible to punish the parents if the offspring shares violence or child pornography videos. Getting the child benefit cancelled for one year might remind some parents impressively of their parenting assignment. 

But these solutions are probably too easy to find. This is where our policy prefers to deprive harmless men's singing and womenrowing societies of non-profit - another article today, which makes me as a normal citizen swallow the comb."
"19","NEUTRAL","You don't have to shoot sparrows with the bazoos right away. And their idea of controlling smartphones is in the wrong direction. Just as we knew at our age where we could hide things that our parents shouldn't see, it is with today's youth, just digital. The problem is much deeper. Many parents don't know (or think) that their child might have to do with this. Rather, the powers of youth offices should be extended so that such cases can be sanctioned. I have 3 children of the ‚ÄúWhatsapp‚Äù age and have often seen that stuff was posted in class chats. My children immediately came to me and I tried to talk to the parents of the ‚Äúposters‚Äù about it. 90% refusal, statements like ‚ÄúMy son does not do this‚Äù, ‚ÄúHe did not want it‚Äù etc. The same applies to violence among children, which is already practiced in kindergarten. Since there can be no perpetrators, there are obviously no victims. The Youth Welfare Office is powerless, maybe sending a speaker to educate the parents. Which doesn't work if the parents of the perpetrators don't show up."
"20","NEUTRAL","Oreo xD... Eh I mean, how can they only üò§ First in my √º40 Facebook group upset about it."
"21","NEGATIVE","There would also be solutions to these problems if they were to be tackled.

Furthermore, a classic case of parental education, but that is no longer desired nowadays."
"22","NEGATIVE","Beer from 16 years. Nicotine from 16 years. Other alcohol and porn from 18 years old.

Smartphones from 0 years.

As far as the legal situation.

Any questions?

It's not about WhatsApp & Co and pictures/videos. This is only a small problem for many of the entire digital madness - in the truest sense of the word - for children/adolescents as well as adults.

And the frequent reference to the parents here in the comments is also always funny. I myself father of three guys - two are studying now and the third is in 9th grade and will also go his way. 

Throughout the years, I have vehemently ‚Äúworked on‚Äù this whole topic around ‚Äúdigitalization‚Äù. As a computer scientist certainly with much more possibilities - both technical and non-technical in the sense of what is good, what is bad, what is reasonable from what age, etc. 

Fortunately, it has probably been halfway.

But if I had children under 10 years of age today, I wouldn't be able to do it anymore. Dot! It has taken up proportions that are no longer manageable even for responsible parents. Dot! 

Both prohibitions as well as conversation/speaking/discussions etc. go completely into the void when the external environment lives completely past these prohibitions. If violence/crime in my immediate environment (and nothing else is the smartphone for children/teenagers today) is a normal state and no police intervene, then no conversation/discussion rounds with the delicacy will help. You know enough. 

But why has this happened in the last five years? Why has the handling of ‚Äúdigitalization‚Äù developed so devastating?

Quite simple. Release alcohol to children/adolescents and they have collossal damage and especially addicts within 5 years. And this happened here. Addiction.

Just nobody wants to know. Because addiction. Ask an alcoholic if he's addicted or a smoker.

Consequences?"
"23","POSITIVE","So I'm a smoker and I'm too addictive. I don't have a problem with that. On the smartphone I also feel a certain dependence but I wouldn't call it an addiction. The Internet (all-inclusive) simply offers always new content and endless possibilities for entertainment at any time of day or night. You get used to it without question but ‚Äúaddiction‚Äù?

In addition, I have to ask once again: Where does it say that the Internet must be suitable for children? It's not a casino or a brothel either. Both can be found on the Internet and that's no secret. So it is the duty of parents to ensure that their children are at least prepared when they enter the world."
"24","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúAt Tom's school, for example, says Tobias Knopp, responsible use of smartphones has not been a topic so far in class or project days.‚Äù - the essential answer of a father whose son has already been ‚Äúenjoying‚Äù criminally relevant content? As long as parents see the primary responsibility for the rational use of a smartphone by their children at school and teachers, hops and malt are lost. 
 ‚ÄúIn the end, everyone agreed that we needed a seminar at school.‚Äù - common sense and time for the children are unfortunately sold out at the moment..."
"25","MIXED","An important and underestimated issue. School without a mobile phone is almost no longer possible, keyword cyberhomework. However, if I find anything offensive on my son's mobile phone, I can only inform the class teachers and the school management in addition to talking to my son. I would remove my son from the chat and delete all the pictures.
We parents need to be one step ahead. Faster than the children and schools, and sometimes more critical in this field. It's about protecting children. You have to be prepared to make unpopular decisions. Mobile phone restrictions and necessarily install a monitoring app.
I only allowed my son (10) the children variant of YouTube. Of course, severely restricts the choice, but his child's soul will be grateful."
"26","NEGATIVE","‚Äúonly the children's version of YouTube‚Äù
At YT there is hardly any really offensive nor in the adult version.
I hope they have platforms such as: LiveLeak also blocked and of course everything about YouPorn, and Ko. Is there still ‚Äúrotten.com‚Äù?
If you take it seriously, you first have to block the entire Internet and unlock only what you have previously checked. And children are very resourceful. Blocked pages can also be displayed, for example, if you use the translator function on Google. Because then it's a Google address. You have to become an Internet scurity specialist. Which is not wrong. With this, they get a well-paid job after the parenting period."
"27","NEGATIVE","This is not new, the dimensions are quite different but I still remember. I am now 30 and 15 years ago I have already shown decapitation videos and pornography on the phones of classmates who he wanted to have himself just had to activate Bluetooth and let it send."
"28","NEUTRAL","And another 15 years before, you just swapped disks on the school yard.
Another 15 years before, just smuddelbooftchen made the round.

Not new. Only the medium and the mass is different."
"29","NEGATIVE","When I look at and listen to some ‚Äúcomedian‚Äù, there are also mostly insults, mockery, riot, faecal language. Kids want to top it."
"30","NEGATIVE","Children, as a rule, have parents.
Teachers should promote and educate them.
But parents have a duty to educate their kids and teach them decency and social behavior.
Seems like some producers have forgotten this."
"31","NEGATIVE","This is also because of all the anti-authoritarian stuff that's so fashionable nowadays, the kids can do whatever they want."
"32","NEUTRAL","How to combat the abuse of freedom of information and the possibilities of modern technology, one of the great problems of today's society.
How can you at least protect the children? I see hardly feasible answers."
"33","NEUTRAL","Most parents are overwhelmed with the technique itself or simply do not care.
WhatsApp is actually only 16 years old..."
"34","POSITIVE","Legally, most smartphones belong to parents. When can I use WhatsApp?
Nice to push the schools the problem..."
"35","NEGATIVE","The school can't fix this. If parents don't finally start taking responsibility from an early age, through conversation, control, upbringing, then it gets much worse. And what brings a ban on mobile phones in school, the children also have free time."
"36","NEGATIVE","The AfD is to blame!"
"37","NEUTRAL","And when I don't know any more, I'll start a working group. Either there's a ban on mobile phones or not."
"38","NEGATIVE","I think that a ban on mobile phones in school would make a difference. It is not possible for my child to be shown harmful content in school via the mobile phone of other children. It can't be that kids get bullied in these crap chats."
"39","MIXED","In principle, I agree with you, but the idea that without a mobile phone would be less bullied, I would reject. Children have always understood how to make life hell for others. In my experience, the typical reaction of the faculty is either to demand a conversation in which apologies are pronounced that are not meant seriously (for which the bullying gets one missed behind the gym), or to conduct the perpetrator-victim repentance and ask the bullying what they do to be bullied."
"40","POSITIVE","Beautiful new world!"
"41","NEGATIVE","Why can't you put a ban on mobile phones at school? At work, I can't walk around with my cell phone and chat."
"42","NEUTRAL","The mobile phone ban already exists (at least in Bavaria, see Art. 56 V p. 1 BayeuG). Whether it is sufficiently controlled is another question. Here, however, parents should have a pedagogical effect."
