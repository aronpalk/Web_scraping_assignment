"1","NEUTRAL","How about just putting the money in schools? When expanding the network, I see the providers as a duty!"
"2","NEUTRAL","The picture of the Federal Cabinet shows one luminary next to the other. And all 20 years of our era back. 
No dear people: no progress in sight. The demand for catching up is bought at billion. Just to reach the edge of the box."
"3","NEGATIVE","Germany should probably stop by to other EU countries, they get it, but we don't. Not to mention the increasing problems with receiving or mobile Internet. I live in Berlin-Mitte and have trouble and need, that times the LTE, respectively 4G sign is displayed. Sometimes complete failure of a few minutes or hours."
"4","NEGATIVE","Mr Scholz, you should collect the powdered toll billions of Mr. Scheuer and then take another billion to reduce the German civil servant monster.
There would still be money left to create the single pension. What do I mean with it?
> Pensioners, civil servants, self-employed doctors, etc., politicians etc., all integrate into a single pension system. 
 If not, then your beautiful DEMOCY will be flying around your ears at some point
 Take a look beyond the borders > with yellow vests it starts!!"
"5","NEGATIVE","How ridiculous are the demands of the SPD??? I lived in NL until 7 years ago and there it was already standard..."
"6","NEGATIVE","Farmers will be helped to ‚Äúbuild 5G networks on their arable land‚Äù. You won't be able to eat the radiation. The frivolous representatives of the people should rather familiarize themselves with the possible dangers of this new technology. 5g should not be installed in Brussels. Why don't you think so?"
"7","NEUTRAL","Why is it called ‚Äúthe government pays‚Äù? The government has no money, the money comes from the taxpayers. So why is the taxpayer not involved in the profits of the corporations?
@Greta G.: On the on-shore wind turbines you can attach the transmitter/receiver all around, there you don't even need your own radio masts. Anyone who wants to. It's not wanted. Germany inhaled Merkel's capitalist socialism."
"8","NEUTRAL","At every on-shore windmill a radio pole would already help"
"9","NEGATIVE","I am surprised that no redistribution and expropriation are being discussed in the radio towers, which are justified by the citizens as inclusion of adults or the avoidance of EU limits on electrosmog"
"10","NEUTRAL","Why at the sight of Scholz on the photo I see that the administrative expenses alone will devour about 1 billion euros.."
"11","NEGATIVE","Well, if you take into account the cost of the advisors... then the $1 billion won't be enough, that's clear."
"12","POSITIVE","I think it is remarkable and exemplary that Minister Scheuer has declared himself ready to set up a mobile phone tower in the immediate vicinity of his house. People cannot be more impressed by fear of possible radiation exposure. Hats off, Mr. Scheuer!"
"13","POSITIVE","Mr. Scheuer understood that the closer you are to the nearest base station, the radiation from the smartphone on your own ear will be the smaller the radiation from your smartphone.
And that is the crucial point. The energy emitted and absorbed by the body comes almost exclusively from its own device. In comparison, there is almost nothing to expect from the 60m aerial on the roof, which can be neglected.
With every further meter distance, there is less and less.
So Mr. Scheuer acts rationally and with political calculus, he is not heroic..."
"14","NEUTRAL","Wowww, a billion, you can buy a lot of cables and masts.
Or is the big part of it already for the consultants?"
"15","NEGATIVE","Now say one more thing that the government does not do anything for the population. A billion for the people to finally meet the needs of the constantly complaining people. It's coming over like they're paying for us out of their own pocket. What do you know as a small consumer, when you negotiate with a craftsman, you decide beforehand what is where to do, in what period and how expensive it can be. No one has even thought of minimal self-evidences here."
"16","NEUTRAL","Well, yes, with numbers like that, I have my doubts anyway. Here's a billion, there's five, there's two... I hope there are experts behind the politicians who have calculated the whole thing a little more precisely. Where is a mast, how much does construction and operation cost, etc. Not that in the end there are a few spots left: -)"
"17","NEGATIVE","It would be enough for me to have a working landline with internet access, which every German citizen should have since the beginning of 2018 and that has not become. Greeting from the Ruhrpott"
"18","NEUTRAL","A further article will be reported on how digitalisation and de-bureaucratisation is progressing in Germany: Cash receipt!"
"19","NEUTRAL","Why do you have to apply for child benefit, for example? The act of birth in conjunction with the residence is quite sufficient. Both are known to the authorities."
"20","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúThe act of birth in connection with the residence is quite sufficient. Both are known to the authorities.‚Äù - Oh, not, ‚ÄúThe authorities‚Äù do not exist here. There is authority A, authority B, authority C etc. which can or may not communicate with each other, the data protection! You can then run as a messenger from A to B to give it signed to C."
"21","NEUTRAL","To expand more than one million of our taxpayers' money by 1% of the network?
I assume that after questioning various consulting firms is expected to be scarcely on edge and the amount will be doubled later? But this is not foreseeable before...; -)"
"22","POSITIVE","Actually, mobile phone technology consumes quite a lot of energy. Here you could save instead of turning off people's heating or making them so expensive that they can only freeze. And the older generation knows well that you can live happy and satisfied even without being online constantly (or at all): -)."
"23","NEUTRAL","If the gap is financed by taxpayers' money, will tariffs be cheaper? Otherwise, users pay twice."
"24","NEUTRAL","Oh, whoever has believed that the STATE has firmly planned the 6 billion captured for the expansion of the networks, is now surprised to rub his eyes. As we know, the pleasures of politics always come first... then for quite a while nothing... and then only after the protests can no longer be ignored and the ship is sinking, the little rest for the subjects... in a country where we live well and willingly. üò§"
"25","NEGATIVE","That's great. First the state collects billions for licenses from the providers, then the providers take this money back from the customers and in the end the customer pays for the expansion of the networks. 
Who's losing? the customer/taxpayer. Nothing else can be expected from this government."
"26","NEUTRAL","@ Bernd S.: Everywhere customers ultimately pay the infrastructure. But first the state is stuffing its pockets and then it points to the evil telecoms companies. The DTAG also adds that the shop belongs to the Confederation.

It's all folly dumbling. It is not for nothing that D is at the bottom of infrastructure/network coverage and at the forefront of charges."
"27","NEGATIVE","I always find it funny to watch people when they're stuck in a radio hole like that. You could also deal with something else at that moment."
"28","NEUTRAL","Is there anything other than Facebook and WhatsApp?"
"29","NEGATIVE","Wow, a billion. Say one of our government's not doing anything for the infrastructure.
Well, if you deduct the consultant costs, I guess nothing remains."
"30","NEGATIVE","Isn't that a little little Kafkaesk? The government auctions the necessary licenses very expensive and then takes taxpayers' money to ‚Äúspeed up‚Äù the network expansion.
The population has once again doubled: expensive mobile tariffs, because network operators have to pass on the money of the licenses and then pay taxes so that the government accelerates the expansion of the network."
"31","NEUTRAL","How right they are with their finding."
"32","NEGATIVE","Our federal government is a layman acting force that shovels the money out of the window... we're all watching... but none of us dare to say anything..."
"33","NEUTRAL","With the cross in the right place at the next election, you can already say a lot. Unfortunately, 75% of citizens wanted it exactly that way."
"34","NEGATIVE","Unbelievable. ‚Ç¨1 billion is nothing compared to the hundreds of billions that are thrown out of the window. And we had to wait so long for that to be implemented. I can't believe it."
"35","POSITIVE","First of all, it's decided. Until this is done, a lot of water will flow down the river Spree!"
"36","NEGATIVE","With the biggest problem is often enough the mature citizen himself, want to have everything super clean electricity, widespread mobile network, but when it comes to everyone and complain everything that takes forever binds resources and ultimately is still very expensive. However, the state must sometimes create facts, then such important things can be enforced without the quatter being able to shoot again and again in between."
"37","NEUTRAL","What about the citizens' initiatives that collect signatures against broadcasting systems?"
"38","NEGATIVE","That is yes times ne announcement, but whether that is enough and when it is realized, questionable... just too late, should have been done long ago..."
"39","NEGATIVE","Mr Braun also wants to profile himself and forgets to mention that during the negotiations on the basis of 5G, this situation could have long since been fixed by the bidding companies in contracts and thus resolved. Now the taxpayer pays and Mr. Braun smiles into the cameras. He took over this from Mr Scheuer, who smiles away his personal inadequacy in the job. And next to it, Mrs. Giffey, so that SPD and women can also see some of the dilemma. I think of Germany at night..."
"40","NEUTRAL","The Confederation will take 1.1 billion in its hands!! Not a word of tax money. It seems only possible to cover up problems with these same taxpayers' money, let alone solve it. With this idea, I imagine how problems should be solved when there are no more funds to be distributed!? And, as is the case of a Management Board of a AG when it comes to the shareholders and has to take account of them. Faith to solve problems with money and/or growth is erroneous."
"41","NEUTRAL","In this regard, I imagine how problems should be solved when there are no more funds to be distributed! ‚Äú

Quite simple. Where it is not worthwhile to set up a mast, there will be a spark holes."
"42","MIXED","That was to be seen ahead! Anyone who gives sovereign duties to private individuals (healthcare, telephone, post office, etc.) knows in advance that there will be no holes left! The providers only make network available where it is worthwhile for them. In the ‚Äúoutback‚Äù, the taxpayer is supposed to take over the unprofitable himself. If the state submits such tasks to private individuals, it must, with waterproof contracts, ensure that the WHOLE country is provided equally by these individuals!
But it is precisely those who do not pay in the end the coal itself, or the citizen!"
"43","NEUTRAL","Internet is new territory for all of us - fast and fast..."
"44","POSITIVE","Only the plans to digitize the AfD have convinced me so far"
"45","NEGATIVE","With the biggest problem is often enough the mature citizen himself, want to have everything super clean electricity, widespread mobile network, but when it comes to everyone and complain everything that takes forever binds resources and ultimately is still very expensive. But the state must sometimes create facts that, then such important things can be punched without the rioting can shoot again and again in between."
"46","NEGATIVE","Politics should learn to make good contracts (constraints), then such tax wastes would not be needed.

The ruling parties have not been able to keep the country modern and make it fit for the future for decades. Such 'lighthouse' actions do not help. 

One cannot even say that this would be a step in the right direction."
"47","NEGATIVE","Whenever I see these people I wonder, there has been a government that no one wanted anymore but just did NOT want to resign!? I'm 40 and can't remember maybe someone knows"
"48","NEGATIVE","The problem is, in fact, that wrong goals are being targeted here. It must cover the area, not that of households. Moreover, the question of whether industry really needs to be 'pampered' by the state, not to mention whether there are operators for the new radio towers. There's still air up here as far as planning is concerned."
"49","MIXED","The problem with politicians is and remains, the necessary expertise in action with business thinking and acting.
Unfortunately, the profession of politician requires little or little expertise and is probably the only
where the expertise does not have to be submitted/proven before taking office!"
"50","POSITIVE","You really say something true!!!"
"51","NEUTRAL","Coalition agreement: ‚ÄúWe are bringing the gigabit networks to all regions: EUR 10 to 12 billion for nationwide fibre-optic networks, as far as possible directly as possible to the house. Removal of existing radio holes. Forerunner role in building the real-time mobile standard 5G. Free Wi-Fi at all public facilities, trains and stations of Deutsche Bahn.
We create a citizen-close, digital administration: digital citizens' portal for citizens and businesses that makes virtually all administrative services available electronically. ‚ÄúDigital First‚Äù principle: priority of digital administration services over the need for personal presentation or written form.‚Äù"
"52","NEGATIVE","Thought too short again!
The radio licences would have been subject to specific conditions and timing requirements, which would also be required in rural areas to provide a compulsory supply to management owners.
The government is solely responsible for the current situation with improvement at the expense of taxpayers!"
"53","NEUTRAL","Germany 2019!!"
"54","NEUTRAL","The EUR 1 billion is not more than a symbolic act to affirm goodwill. In order to really tackle digitalization, completely different sums and legal changes are needed. 
But our tax money is increasingly needed every year for non-forward-looking measures."
"55","NEGATIVE","Are they the same planners as the BER?

Will it actually cost ‚Äúonly‚Äù one billion euros? 

How much of the sum is put on us consumers?

Completion before 2030? Or more like 2130?

Cisco or Huawei?


Questions about questions..."
"56","NEGATIVE","The mobile communications companies have no interest in supplying rural areas nationwide. Few customers equal little profit. And at that time, and certainly also at 5G, our government failed to oblige the corporations to provide a comprehensive supply when issuing the licences.
So the familiar game, privatize profits and socialize losses."
"57","NEUTRAL","And how to do this without Huawei?"
"58","NEGATIVE","In other countries with much lower population density, this seems to work much better. And if it costs just over ‚Ç¨1 billion - why hasn't it been done long ago? Ten billions are being thrown out of the window, especially since 2015 and one thing - fundamental for a developed country - simply remains. Irresponsibility or inability or both?"
"59","NEUTRAL","According to the 5G Association, the 5G expansion without Huawei in Germany will last at least 2 years longer and at least 10 billion euros more expensive"
"60","NEUTRAL","The German government has purchased 100 billion from mobile operators for the LTE licenses, this money is naturally lacking in the construction of the network. Returning 1 billion of these to fill the last LTE gaps is more than fine. 

Is there a schedule?"
"61","NEGATIVE","Digitalization is progressing!
We now have enough zeros in government and opposition.
Now only a few more ones are missing..."
"62","NEGATIVE","Providers are not able to comply with their contractual obligations, so the taxpayer has to bleed. Then the consumer pays twice again. Our money is good and happy to throw around you!"
"63","NEUTRAL","Socializing costs (radio towers), making profits recovered. Does that look like the ‚Äúfree market‚Äù?"
"64","NEUTRAL","I hope the Scheuer has not already concluded any contracts in advance"
"65","NEUTRAL","It is much more important to fill the holes in politics that the depicted ladies and gentlemen have caused.
We can still live very well with radio holes. This is just about subsidies for the economy, and the ordinary consumer is once again excluded."
"66","NEGATIVE","I come from a city with the star (Daimler). For me, Telekom has 6.5 Mbytes as top speed and my mobile phone shows E. I repeat, I come from a city with a star and do not live anywhere in the country."

If so,..."
"68","NEGATIVE","Previous on the radio:
We have internet quality like Angola - but the country has a civil war behind it with considerable destruction of its infrastructure.

"69","NEUTRAL","The population must therefore pay their own future, taxpayers' money, and on top of that, in comparison with other countries, pay the highest cost of Internet to mobile operators.
That's what I call once again a typical German ‚Äúprogress‚Äù, out of this government."
"70","NEGATIVE","Dear Mr. Scheuer,
I still cannot understand why the ‚Äúmarket‚Äù that you always praised about the clover cannot solve this problem.
And now the state itself has to set up the radio towers instead of carving the laws that oblige the providers to do so?
Have certainly recommended their ‚Äúadvisers‚Äù so."
"71","NEGATIVE","Oh, dabbly ducks at work. Digitalization is already behind us. Government you wanted to think bigger, then no longer digitization, but quantization. Digitization is already an old hat and you are always so innovative, then you can certainly also quantify."
"72","NEGATIVE","‚ÄúIt is about reducing bureaucracy and creating a modern and effective welfare state. A good cellular structure is a prerequisite for this. ‚Äú
Yes... this welfare state is unfortunately at the top of the agenda."
"73","NEGATIVE","Your last sentence: Yes, but not for us.
No problem has been solved, even if they still celebrate so much up there.

"74","NEUTRAL","Dismantling personal contact with the citizen, dismantling and digitalization. For this, Hartz IV and no employment. Do we really want to?"
"75","NEGATIVE","Since I am rather critical of mobile communications with its radiations, I would have liked it if this money had been used to extend the normal Internet infrastructure via fibre, so that there is still nature without mobile radiation harmful to human animals and plants.

It is simply unacceptable that there are commercial establishments in Munich that are now switched off the ISDN line and whose telephone system is now to be operated via a 1,000 DSL via Voice over IP. (Internet may be possible through a private contract from the neighbouring municipality)"
"76","POSITIVE","128Kbps ISDN is better for voice than PARTIALURLPLACEHOLDER DSL?"
"77","NEUTRAL","Quote: ‚ÄúFederal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) complained for too long approval procedures in the expansion of mobile infrastructure.‚Äù 

That's right. Well, Mr. Scheuer was not born yet, or was in kindergarten, primary school, where many of the bureaucratic hurdles and bureaucracy became law by federal and state governments. 
The world of local, district and state administration looked completely different in the 50s, 60s, partly taken over from the Prussian administration period. And with the progressing computer and digital time, not or only insufficiently adapted as processes devoured.

Anyone who wants to see how and where the old Prussia is still - in fact - lived - only has to look around in so many German courts, administrations and even police officers. Documents, forms and stamp culture as they were from Emperor's times."

There were no milk jugs there."
"81","NEUTRAL","Yesterday visit near Meseberg with friends. 
A lot of police but little network.
That was 3 cozy hours in the very deep hole of the non-existent net.
Nets that have holes are unfit.

In Meseberg, who is surprised, there is now a broadcast mast so that the members of the round can also tweet with their family on Sunday. 
Was it not in Honnecker's times that he was driven only over roads and through landscapes where winding elements were shown at the side of the road?

I'm Wessi and only know by hearsay. Or is that fake news?"
"82","NEGATIVE","I don't understand. The problem is not that all network operators cover a total of 99%, but that each network operator sets its priorities elsewhere. I only have one vendor. The only reasonable solution would be national romaning. All other numbers on paper without an effect."
"83","NEGATIVE","Bitcom President Achim Berg warned already in mid-2018 (https://www.5g-anbieter.info/ratgeber/reichweite.html):

‚ÄúWith this (with 5G) no economic coverage can be produced. On average, a transmitting mast would have to be installed every kilometre, connected with fibreglass and supplied with electricity. We would have to dig up all of Germany in order to achieve the required area coverage. This is simply not feasible and goes past the realities of mobile communications. ‚Äú

What a farmer would need 5G for in his fields (which could not be done with LTE, but which they often don't have) would also interest me very much. I think that most farmers have completely different worries..."
"84","NEUTRAL","Of course, farmers need 5G.

The new agricultural machines are designed to determine the settings from the data themselves."
"85","NEUTRAL","How generous: a whopping ‚Ç¨1.1 billion for the expansion of an infrastructure for which it was allowed to build, previously about ‚Ç¨55 billion was put into the bag.

But the bill is not entirely correct. Expenses from the auctions could or could be claimed for tax purposes, write-off the required investments of infrastructure expansion. In an international comparison, access to infrastructure is linked to tariffs, which are characterised by (in some cases significant) performance limitations and are only reasonably usable in the high-price segment (provided that no coverage is expected).

Some commercial operations are not or are inadequately attainable, which reduces sales and thus means lower tax revenues. Innovation and competitiveness are limited, while social purchasing power is reduced.

Had one obliged instead of the licence fee an area extension, a technically up-to-date minimum service and structural opening, it is entitled to assume that the bill (technologically, economically pp.) would be different."
"86","NEUTRAL","And one more word about Giffey's digital leap in civilization: 
In Sweden, an automatic procedure takes its course with the announcement of the birth of a new ‚Äútax citizen‚Äù, as a newborn is lovingly called official German.

It is explicitly a! only one! bureaucratic act, which informs all the competent authorities. The required documents/documents are served, state benefits are automatically granted (child benefit for example, without any change until the age of 16), etc.
I repeat, there is one for that! bureaucratic act required.

We should be curious to see what is understood in this country by modernising and reducing bureaucracy."
"87","NEUTRAL","Expertise? Nah, what for?
‚Ç¨1.1 billion, so that ‚Äúmobile phone calls can be made in all households as well as on roads and in rural areas‚Äù. Not understood: 5G expansion is not about calling, but about IoT services.
‚ÄúMobile phone structure prerequisite‚Äù so that ‚Äúbirth certificate, child supplement, parental allowance and child benefit can be applied in a digital format‚Äù? No, that would already be done today via fixed lines ‚Äî if the administrations were to set it up. But they don't. And who should believe that mobile communications will suddenly lead to the creation of online services offered by administrations?
With so much clueless, there is no need to be surprised that Germany is digitally lost."
"88","NEUTRAL","I assumed that over 5G can be called like via 3G and 4G. Am I wrong here? In fact, mobile telephony would have to go over the IP protocol in order to have as few protocols as possible in the future."
"89","NEUTRAL","As a reminder - for the basic pension there are also 1-1.5 billion, that is, for 1 million+ people to make their existence worth living (?..). The Internet seems to play an equal role"
"90","NEUTRAL","Hello Bernhard, apart from the fact that this investment in 5G seems very questionable to me too, this sum would be _one-time_ - the basic pension, on the other hand, _permanent_return_ and sharply increasing every year.


There are many government (s) projects in DE that could be removed in favor of this or that."
"91","NEUTRAL","Achieving this goal is not the responsibility of the state, but the mobile operator.
I do not see the best will that even one cent of taxpayers' money will be used for this.
Apart from that, until now, the state has not really been filmed with fame when it has intervened in any projects.
Hamburg: Elbphilharmonie
Brandenburg: BER
Stuttgart: Stuttgart 21
...
...
..."
"92","NEGATIVE","‚ÄúI do not see the best will that even one cent of taxpayers' money will be used for this.‚Äù

I find this view too simple. By auctioning frequencies, the state has so far collected about 66 billion. These costs were 1) passed on to you as a customer via the fees of their service provider and 2) the providers lack these sums for network expansion.

Earnings so far:
UMTS (3G): approx. 50 billion euros (2000)
LTE NETWORK (4G): 9.46 billion euros. (2010)
5G: 6.6 billion euros (2019)

I want to protect the provider God does not know. But at least economically, I can easily understand that not every white spot is being opened up by them. 
Due to the frequency of auctions, the state is not less responsible for the misery than this by milking the providers.
The network is a modern pillar of infrastructure. And the preservation and expansion of these is one of the main tasks of the state and politics. 
The laced is and remains the customer!"
"93","NEUTRAL","I do not believe that the expansion of mobile communications will lead to a significant reduction in administrative administration due to digitalisation.

But I also like to be positively surprised."
"94","NEGATIVE","Bigfoot: It's going to get worse. If digitalization really needs fewer administrators, they will probably want to control more areas of life and business and monitor and limit us."
"95","NEUTRAL","I don't know. The Roman Empire existed without Internet. Columbus discovered the sea route to India- without internet. Okay, it was an upstream island called America. Even the Wehrmacht made it to Stalingrad without Google Maps and you were amazed again...

When our wise big chairman handled her cell phone, she's still afraid to stumble over the cord. She was recently in India to explain this to the Indernet. 

But who says it: now 1.1 billion euros are being powdered so that we can pass North Korea technologically. Romania, Albania and Bangladesh are simply unobtrusible. 

The money could also have been invested in social projects, such as the pension with 62.9 or so. Or the pension for prevented mothers..."
"96","NEUTRAL","Nice air number: No matter how many billions are announced here again. No ‚Äúconversations‚Äù with municipalities and countries help with the German regulation anger and bureaucracy - the BER will finish even faster. This must be regulated by federal laws and the building law or whatever leads to many lawsuits must also be cledged by accelerated procedures.

Apart from this, there is once again a concentrated competence when an effective welfare state is supposedly dependent on mobile networks. Almost as well as storing electricity in the grid."
"97","NEGATIVE","There would certainly be fewer holes if there were not many citizens' initiatives aimed at opposing the construction of radio towers and thus preventing a radio hole from being closed!
How does the federal government want to exclude this disability?"
"98","POSITIVE","@Gerhard D.
Through education, knowledge transfer, information (already in schools). There are now too many people in Germany and Europe (including governments) who believe that ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù can replace sound knowledge and education. The bornness we elevated to virtue.

"99","NEUTRAL","1 billion to partially build jobs off, then colleague app does everything.Furthermore, it will increase the power consumption and thus harmful to the environment. Do you actually know what you do? Why did one scraped the providers with licenses. Also cool what the SPD all pour into access laws, no receipt gives damages. Can one then apply for funds in the European environment even easier online? Then there is no need for child money smuggers anymore: -) Hey we could make a digital asylum allowance, just stay in the home country and apply for the money here, thank you SPD and thank you digitization * Satire Achtung Satire"
"100","POSITIVE","Yes, undoubtedly a real success.

1.1 billion left for closing the black phone holes.

Provided the money is not already planned elsewhere.

So what about broadband expansion in the countryside?
When is something noticeable happening here?
Villages and small towns are long overdue!"
"101","NEUTRAL","Taking ‚Ç¨1 billion in hand to close the mobile phone holes nationwide is a mockery of those who are in the dark because of the government's failures and wrong decisions. They can do this in Berlin and turn it as they want - since 2015 the billions are missing behind and ahead."
"102","NEUTRAL","Especially in the advertising brochures: 20% discount on everything! Hardware store t... we close! Estimate 20 employees looking for a job shortly. 5-10 MA may find new employment in the competition. The rest? Cross-entry teacher? Ki Ta temporary aid or yet AA? 

Now even the DIY industry is weakening, in the super-ruled South Baden region."
"103","POSITIVE","There are so many great and exciting new professions in the beautiful new world, for example scooter loaders or pizza, burger and Suhsi riders. Otherwise, simply wait for green citizens' money, then no one will have to work anyway, all will live in prosperity and in harmony with nature."
"104","NEGATIVE","Large projects and Andi Scheuer = total damage"
"105","NEGATIVE","At the same time, it was noted that the Cabinet definitely did not have to die of thirst at the excise session. And a fruity refreshment was also served. Only in the fruit salad there are nowhere non-seasonal import fruits with a disastrous carbon footprint.

A government that wants to restrict the people in their freedoms because of the alleged and man-made climate heating, and once again more vigorous taxation must lead by example and eat only domestic and seasonal fruits; in cold and rainy November there are still very few apples and pears in it. Bananas, on the other hand, are taboo all year round, but the Chancellor should not have any problems with that."
"106","NEUTRAL","You don't seriously believe that only one of these people is willing to give up anything he wants you to do without it? This is the new self-proclaimed nobility (or elite) that make themselves a spoil of dfas land!"

"112","NEUTRAL","The digitalization madness overtakes itself as nobody ever loses a word about what new health damage is caused by this permanent PC use. It starts with an unnatural sitting posture, in which both arms have to run half bent over the PC keyboard. Then the constant looking up at the screen, constantly putting your head in the neck. Muscular and facial diseases accumulate, which harm overall physically and until now are only trivialized.
On the other hand, digitalization also relies on power supply. What electrosmog the PC users are exposed to is concealed.
Last but not least, the exorbitant increase in electricity prices through ambitious politicians' goals to turn Germany into a model state for eco-economy that does not generate energy itself, but purchases expensively from abroad. How honest is this, do not want to get your hands dirty, fooling the Saubermann, and then buying dirty electricity e.g. from obsolete nuclear power plants from abroad. This is political vanity at all levels, which is absolutely incompatible with."

The receipt is received by end customers, with poor network coverage and horrendous fees."
"115","NEGATIVE","Horror fees = electricity!"
"116","NEGATIVE","In the ZDF, it was reported that the money comes from other pots for digitization. In other words, it is only restrained and other measures are thus shifted backwards. In addition, there is a misleading percentage in the game: apartments instead of areas. If a high percentage of apartments is indicated, they are usually present in conurbations. The less densely built-up areas are crucial, which are much more in number and the coverage is supposed to be laughably low. Like, for example, along the railway lines! Here the Germans are once again deliberately scattered sand in the eyes of their government!"
"117","MIXED","Creativity is therefore sufficient, only no competence."
"118","NEGATIVE","So taking money in your hand, I guess it's not done - is it?"
"119","NEUTRAL","Oh, Huawei won't mind!"
"120","NEUTRAL","It's all specialists at work!"
"121","NEUTRAL","The Federal Republic of Germany invests 6.6 billion euros and 1.1 billion euros. This EUR 1.1 billion think 1% of estimated total costs. Why does the state not invest a little more?"
"122","NEGATIVE","I don't believe a word

I've been hearing this blame since 2007. 
But ever. Behind Uganda there is still room in the list"
"123","NEGATIVE","Even this project will not support the ‚ÄúGroko‚Äù, it will remain with the announcements, but what the hell, many if not all today's participants will no longer be members of the government after the next Bundestag election, so who cares, ‚ÄúGroko‚Äù has long since ‚Äúfinished‚Äù ... : (
Poor land!"
"124","NEUTRAL","Citizens will find themselves to take care of the polluters once they no longer enjoy all-round protection."
"125","POSITIVE","Finally our Heiko can be seen again. For a few days, they didn't hear from him. Great, he certainly came from jogging, or how can I interpret the training jacket in the photo of the world?"
"126","NEGATIVE","The oligopoly cheers. High prices, moderate performance and now the state is also filling up the gaps. That's great. 
T-Mobile, Vodafone, Telefonica and United Internet are bowing towards Berlin."
"127","MIXED","This is very commendable... But what means are the holes in competence in the government?"
"128","NEGATIVE","You can't have everything."
"129","NEGATIVE","Once again, politics mistakenly thinks that you just have to take enough money into your hands, and then you could push any technological development in the desired direction. I have not seen the question that there may be other reasons why companies are only weaker in favour of expansion, unlike other countries. There are certain issues of bureaucracy and attitude towards technical innovation. On both points, I have not yet been able to see that there is a positive attitude among our leaders. It is always more convenient to discuss fears and build up bureaucracy than vice versa! If you look alone at what funds are going into some pseudo-studies to endanger mobile communications, you don't have to be surprised."
"130","POSITIVE","Significant, for exactly what Mrs Giffey wants to push ahead with the expansion. Not for the economy, for example, for revenue, but for easier redistribution, that is, expenditure."
"131","NEGATIVE","Whoever earns billions with the frequency auction is waiting for the surplus income from VAT in addition to the happiness of the income. Prices have to cover these expenses and the hurdle where it is not worth it is accordingly high. Maybe it's a little fairer, but the revenue isn't getting out of the way - sand litter."
"132","NEUTRAL","Wow. EUR 6.6 billion, the federal government purchased the mobile radio licenses from network operators in June 2019 and now manages to allocate only 1 billion for the expansion of unprofitable areas. Of this, 20 -30% will certainly be spent on the appropriations. Really impressive."
"133","NEGATIVE","Hey, the poor polioticians want to live on what and so they don't have to work so hard, they buy a lot of advisers that costs everything!!!!"
"134","NEUTRAL","Whoa. Apply for the birth certificate online, here the government is once again sharing one of its boldest visions, thanks for that.

And to what extent should the expansion of our mobile networks be the prerequisite for an effective welfare state?"
"135","NEGATIVE","That's what Mrs. Giffey says. To request all transfers conveniently from the sofa. More effort would be required too much."
