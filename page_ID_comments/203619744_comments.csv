"1","NEGATIVE","I can't imagine CDU voters were thinking of choosing a coalition with the Greens and the Left. This is even worse than the grand coalition, whose fruits we are currently forced to harvest."
"2","NEUTRAL","@Paco 
The fact is that about 75% of the Union supporters are strictly opposed to a coalition with the right-wing AfD. Afdlings can still beg for it.
An AFD government would be the economic and political SUPER GAU for the Federal Republic and the EU."
"3","NEGATIVE","And further will be lied and cheated. The voter's will after a change in Brandenburg was broken with this coalition. Thank you Mr W. then your days are counted."
"4","NEGATIVE","@ Icke
‚ÄúAnd further is lied and deceived. The voter's will after a change in Brandenburg was broken with this coalition.‚Äù
Nope. All three coalition parties excluded cooperation with the right-wing AfD before the election and were elected to the Landtag. 
AFD fans and their party are experiencing difficulties with democratic practices."
"5","NEGATIVE","Kenya coalition is a fraud against the serious voters of the Greens, the FDP and the Union. In the end, it can be governed, but the parties can no longer stand for their content."
"6","NEUTRAL","@Stefan G.
Nope. This corresponds to the will of voters, which did not want to give any party the absolute majority."
"7","NEUTRAL","Have fun, a government made up of political opponents, at least CDU and the other two should not blow into the same horn.

I am curious what comes out of it, something seems like a single party, even though there are many different opinions, the voter actually wants a strong government and an opposition. In the meantime, governments (see Groko) look more like that the government is already hosting an opposition and an extra opposition is still in parliament..."
"8","NEUTRAL","My condolences..."
"9","POSITIVE","Now it's getting really conservative in Brandenburg. Congratulations and good luck for the anti-AFD party. I am also really impressed by how many similarities have been found together that such a coalition can be established, of course, in the interests of the voters and in terms of content. Because I can only think of two similarities. Number 1 - they all want to be in power or remain there - but this certainly applies to all parties and is not reprehensible. Number 2 consists in the most democratic motto - we sort of slipping everything away, because it is not our positions that matter, but only to prevent the AfD. Well then - the best prerequisites for a successful government, which will lead to a further decline of the CDU and thus unintentionally strengthens the party that one would like to prevent."
"10","NEUTRAL","So a Libya coalition?"
"11","NEGATIVE","Why do you always call the coalition according to African or South American countries, I have noticed so much."
"12","NEUTRAL","Because of the congruence of the political colours with the colours of the flags of the respective countries. By the way, Jamaica does not belong entirely to South America, but is an island in the Caribbean; still north of the equator, I think."
"13","NEGATIVE","The minority party of the Greens should thank the AfD in recognition, without it it it would not be able to claim power in this comfortable situation.
In Bavaria this started backwards because of the Free Voters. The self-proclaimed election winner who rides in the yard was suddenly the biggest loser there."
"14","NEUTRAL","Och Siegfried W, do you feel well ‚Äúcared for‚Äù by the media? If so, the media have achieved everything in your home."
"15","NEUTRAL","@ Uwe
Siegi still believes Agitprop."
"16","NEGATIVE","A coalition of the losers. Avanti Diletanti."
"17","POSITIVE","Well, you see, finally we made it here and the Greens are in, then everything has to get much better now. Let's wait, I'm so curious..."
"18","NEGATIVE","What did Gauland say? The AfD has only integere persons in their ranks and the H√∂cke stands in the middle of the party. If that is true, it is good that this party never comes into government responsibility. 
Democrats can compromise and form a government like here. The fact that everyone has to make concessions is normal that is lived democracy."
"19","NEUTRAL","If you translate Gauland's words, it means: ‚ÄúThe party, the party, it's always right...‚Äù"
"20","NEUTRAL","A constellation in the next BT election? According to the current figures quite possible. Well, there's still a little time."
"21","NEUTRAL","It is important that the right-wing AfD is excluded from government participation."
"22","NEGATIVE","AFD fans simply have difficulties with legitimate democratic policies in politics, otherwise they would not be so frantic and groundless oubtedly."
"23","NEUTRAL","What does such exclusion have to do with legitimate democratic practices?
Much of what is happening in politics is ONLY to prevent the AfD to weaknesses or even to prevent it? What do the Greens and the SPD have in common? What do Greens and CDU have in common? 



So if it were the other way around, then it would be perfectly okay for you?! 

Pah... Who believes..."
"24","NEGATIVE","The scaffolding of the so-called Democrats is becoming more and more shaky, and a fourth rotten branch will soon have to hold the scaffolding."
"25","NEUTRAL","Nope. No democratic party is dependent on the ideologically rotten AfD."
"26","NEUTRAL","Irony of history: that's what the AFD voters now have. Greens in government. He's got something."
"27","NEUTRAL","In my view, the CDU is no longer selectable, since it is now a left-wing party. Fortunately, there is an alternative!"
"28","NEUTRAL","@Siegfried W.
‚ÄúThat's right. There are democratic parties as alternatives to the CDU. The non-alternative AfD is excluded from this.‚Äù

And even if you write it so often, it will not and will not be more correct."
"29","NEUTRAL","And that's how it will be full of Kenya."
"30","NEGATIVE","Whether the Brandenburg voters wanted that way is questionable ü§î"
"31","NEUTRAL","But he chose this way"
"32","NEUTRAL","Well, I do. Banana Land..."
"33","POSITIVE","That's great. A new government coalition will do Brandenburg well. Just like in Saxony, if there was a Kenya coalition there. But most importantly, in the end, the Greens will be involved in all state governments after the three state elections in the East. And that there is nothing left for the AFD but the opposition bank completely right-wing. Fragrance and happiness."
"34","POSITIVE","I like optimists."
"35","NEUTRAL","the cdu had in baden w√ºrttemberg times the absolute majority,
now you stand at 27%, in the last election you have lost another 12%!
you can see the collaboration with the green is going well!
but not for the cdu!"
"36","NEGATIVE","the bad thing is that the afd won't come to the government as the big election winner. But the voter wanted that exactly. Democracy has failed in this country."
"37","NEGATIVE","And that is what is called the voter will? The losers are getting together and this is called democracy!"
"38","NEUTRAL","@Daniel 
Of course, the Kenya coalition reflects the ‚Äúvoter will‚Äù. The parties from the Democratic spectrum, i.e. the SPD, the CDU and the GREEN, clearly put the cards on the table before the election, not to coalise with the right-wing AfD."
"39","NEUTRAL","We already have the finished model for the federal government under a chancellor Habeck. I see this as a farewell gift from A.M. to her party."
"40","NEUTRAL","Sure, Chancellor Kurz will launch the black-green prototype in Austria. This must please the many who wish Kurz as Chancellor in Germany as well."
"41","NEUTRAL","It's democracy. It is necessary to understand in the East that in almost all the federal states in the East, the losers are now working together to govern. The elections were almost as pointless as 30 years ago."
"42","NEUTRAL","First of all, it is important to understand in the East that the majority of voters has no interest in the government of the right-wing AfD."
"43","NEUTRAL","So continue profileless ‚Äúkeep going‚Äù? When are elections again?"
"44","POSITIVE","‚ÄúSo continue profileless ‚Äúkeep going‚Äù?‚Äù
Yeah, yeah.
Germany is quite successful.
So ‚ÄúKeep it up‚Äù"
"45","NEUTRAL","CDU and Greens again in a coalition, where CDU and Greens could not be more different. But what once again shows how far the CDU under Mrs. Merkel has already moved to the left and/or has taken over green topics. Because before the Merkel era, no one in the CDU would have wasted even a thought of a coalition with the Greens.

Well, if at some point the CDU should ask itself why one went the same way as the SPD, namely the way down, while the AfD slowly but steadily continued to increase, just look with whom one went into the coalition bed to stay in power and/or come to power.

For true conservatives, including CDU voters before and during the Merkel era, the green party consisting of patrons, forbids, teachers, etc., is and remains an absolute no go."
"46","NEGATIVE","A large part of the German population prefers alliances between black-green, precisely because some movement would finally come into politics. The AfD has reached its zenith because these everlasting yesterday simply do not have meaningful concepts."
"47","NEUTRAL","Another federal state with ‚ÄúB‚Äù which goes down the stream is still missing Bavaria and Baden-W√ºrttemberg."
"48","POSITIVE","Baden-W√ºrttemberg is not going down the drain.
They have a good MP.
One of the Greens.
But I'm sure you already knew that."
"49","POSITIVE","Welcome to standstill. Greetings from Saxony Anhalt!"
"50","POSITIVE","This is consolidation at a high level.
Still better than a backward.
With greeting from Lower Saxony."
"51","POSITIVE","still better than red red"
"52","NEUTRAL","At some point this has been greener, it will take time at the latest when the CDU gets even fewer votes."
"53","NEGATIVE","AfD, calbitz, coalition... can't!"
"54","NEUTRAL","Isn't Kalbitz the right twin of Mr. H√∂cke?"
"55","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúPreviously, social and Christian Democrats had already voted for the Kenyan alliance. ‚Äú

It's okay.
That's where three democratic parties have found themselves."
"56","NEUTRAL","Sure, were also democratically elected."
"57","NEUTRAL","For access to power, some do almost everything...
But it was clear even before the elections...!"
"58","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúBut it was clear even before the elections...!‚Äù

It's good if you do what you promise before the election."
"59","NEUTRAL","This nationalization of coalition colors is really a borderline colonization."
"60","NEUTRAL","Right, but on the other hand, we have ‚ÄúThe Team‚Äù."
"61","NEGATIVE","The term Kenya coalition is wrong because the flag of Kenya still contains white, which is obviously missing.
Afghanisatn coalition is more accurate in every respect!"
"62","NEGATIVE","Perhaps White stands for the policy of the new coalition. 
White, like a blank sheet of paper."
"63","NEUTRAL","The SPD in Brandenburg will be surprised. Woidke is a very sympathetic person, but in this constellation it will be difficult to get through anything."
"64","NEGATIVE","Just keep going. 
But don't flening around when one day the AFD increases in percentages."
"65","NEUTRAL","@Michael R.
‚ÄúJust keep going. ‚Äú
Of course, go on like this! 
Because it does not correspond to the absolute and politically reasonable majority will to cooperate or coalise with the legal AfD."
"66","NEGATIVE","unlike plakafarben, you can no longer distinguish the porridge!
the us security advisor kissinger once said, ‚Äúif everyone is allied with everyone, then nobody is allied with anybody‚Äù because then everything becomes arbitrary!
and so it is, our policy has become arbitrary!"
"67","NEGATIVE","@jinda n. 
‚Äúour policy has become arbitrary!‚Äù
Not at all. The politically reasonable refusal to cooperate with the right-wing AfD is by no means an expression of arbitrariness, but constitutes a clear point of view of democratic orientation."

Since all federal states have to cast their votes uniformly (otherwise the votes do not count), the Greens can block any law in the federal council at any time, and this is why it is an absurd idea to continue pursuing junior partnerships with the Greens in the state governments and then wonder if the Greens (as a small opposition party) actually determine domestic policy in Germany and as a minority majorize the majority (to put it very politely). With Brandenburg another four votes would be added.

It is no wonder that the Greens have seen themselves as the ‚Äúreal‚Äù government for years, and the Greens will continue to play easily with the government if you like to ‚Äútake them on board‚Äù everywhere."
"69","NEUTRAL","We've had that before. Schr√∂der threw away because he was completely blocked in the Federal Council.
Before that, however, he still realized the neoliberal dream of the endless supply of blackmailable low-wage wages and thus established old-age poverty."
"70","NEUTRAL","The Kenya coalition of three democratic parties wanted the greatest possible success for the benefit of Brandenburg and the Federal Republic."
"71","NEGATIVE","There will be eternal discussions with the Greens and no results. Only demanding resources, but strangling one's own economy is not going to be possible in the long run. Lost time! In addition, the star of the Greens will soon fade."
"72","NEGATIVE","the Greens - yes eternal discussion - result - also bend under pressure from FFF
does not go well in the long run - right, only until then unfortunately a lot of water runs..."
"73","NEUTRAL","The last sentence is indicative. ‚ÄúNone of the other parties wanted to coalise with the AfD as the second strongest force.‚Äù
They cling to power with all the contractions... the will of voters is trampled."
"74","NEUTRAL","@Michael L.
‚ÄúThe last sentence is indicative. ‚ÄúWith the AfD as the second strongest force, none of the other parties wanted to coalise.""‚Äù
Because, fortunately, it corresponds to the absulut majority of voters (which is distributed among different parties) not only in Brandenburg, but in the Federal Republic as a whole."
"75","NEUTRAL","It is time to come that after elections no purely interchangeable party-purpose alliances can be made because of the lack of majority attainment and political voters must be taken into account. I look forward to these times."
"76","NEUTRAL","I rather suspect that voters are crumbled; in the sense of: see, your vote has not brought anything - so that your vote is ‚Äúsensible‚Äù again, so that your vote also matters (slogan: choose SPD or CDU or Greens, then you are there, _); -)))"
"77","POSITIVE","Once again very cute, how AFD fans are hysterically eager about the legally impeccable and democratic coalition formation. 
AfD sympathizers are begging for a coaltion with the UNION. 
But Brandenburg can do excellently without the right-wing and superfluous AfD."
"78","NEGATIVE","I would have found a minority government more honest."
"79","POSITIVE","A coalition in breadth coupled with the hope that there may also be a good policy in depth.
Happiness up!"
"80","POSITIVE","They do everything for the benefit of the citizens."
"81","NEGATIVE","Why is it the only ‚ÄúKenya‚Äù coalition? 
Afghanistan has the same colors and would be more appropriate in terms of the political situation!"
"82","NEUTRAL","@ Brenz G.
Nope. Only in terms of colours. Fortunately, the right-wing AfD is not part of the coalition of democratic parties."
"83","NEUTRAL","I'm in SF next week at TESLA for the Akionary Assembly. I will use my voting rights against a factory in Brandenburg. Never again today's Germany."
"84","NEUTRAL","Which one do you mean?"

"86","NEUTRAL","In the group of the AfD."
"87","NEUTRAL","What vadis CDU? You have to assume that you are not afraid of playing the stirrup holder after the next Bundestag election to help Habeck in the saddle? In Baden-W√ºrrtemberg you have already done this on the state level. Anyway, you won't get my voice."
"88","NEUTRAL","if we ever see the day that MEPs do not receive a diet but a salary from which KV/PV, ALG and RV are respected (the time has long been there) and expenses are not paid lump-sum but only on presentation of receipts or receipts (no booking without receipt), company vehicle only with 1% tax etc., the Separating the chaff from the wheat"
"89","POSITIVE","Dear Patricia,

the lush money also did not animate you to go into politics. Do you think a cut will improve the quality?

Then I wouldn't pay out any more money at all, I'm sure the quality will be the best."
"90","NEGATIVE","Yes, political diversity and differentiation have thus been absurd. The will of the voters is trampled and in future it remains only the choice between change-AFD or standstill CDU, SPD, left, green, FDP. It remains to be hoped that people wake up and see the change leaves only one choice."
"91","NEGATIVE","This will be difficult as long as the AFD does not get out of its social pension program.
So far, she has the reputation of the party for better earners.
(Not that the single party had anything left for the weak;) - the fake basic pension also does not solve the problem of old-age poverty at taxpayer's expense..)
Even with the medicinal plant cannabis, the AFD would have to take off its medieval attitude and become more modern."
"92","NEUTRAL","What is the right of these parties from the third to fifth positions of voters to claim that they will form a coalition. 

It turns out where we have arrived."
"93","NEUTRAL","@ Karl N.
‚ÄúWhat is the right of these parties from the third to fifth positions of voters to claim that they will form a coalition. ‚Äú
It's simple. Because the coalition was formed according to legally impeccable democratic rules. 
Before the election, voters were in no way left in the unclear that the democratic parties categorically excluded cooperation with the right-wing AfD. 
The majority of voters opted for different parties from the democratic spectrum and not for right-wing populism."
"94","NEUTRAL","At the main station I feel already remembered Kenya, so why not even a few meters further in the Landtag."
"95","NEUTRAL","What's such a hampel? It doesn't matter who coalise with whom, except with the Afd."
"96","NEUTRAL","@siegfried w.
how do they define ‚Äúpolitically reasonable‚Äù?"
"97","NEUTRAL","The CDU as a majority procurer for red-green. She won't be allowed to go through that in the long term. The CDU has learned nothing from similar steps of the FDP."
"98","POSITIVE","In Baden W√ºrttemberg you obviously have no problems with this."
"99","POSITIVE","Dear voters,

Thank you for your choice and support for our party.
Since it does not matter what you choose - and we just want to get to the posts, we propose that in the future completely abandon elections. This can save a lot of money - because we govern one way or another.
There are no distinctions anymore. We ask for your understanding.

Sincerely, your Unity Party."
"100","NEUTRAL","Political education is necessary."
"101","NEGATIVE","Why do they not form a German Unity Party, then there is no need for coalitions. It's all the same porridge anyway."
"102","NEGATIVE","Unfortunately, with your sad opinion,

"104","NEUTRAL","Frank S.:
You've been AFD basher for a long time, haven't you?"
"105","POSITIVE","It's funny what the AfD client has so much trouble here. 
I think it is good that the agreement is broad across all parties. Even in Brandenburg, democracy remains connected. Good news."
"106","NEUTRAL","What else does democracy have to do if all parties want the same?"
"107","NEGATIVE","‚ÄúThe new cabinet is more feminine and younger than the previous one. ‚Äú

"110","NEUTRAL","And?
Does Kenya want to join?
Jamaica's not part of the game.
Borussia Dortmund, anyway. 

Could you please return from the purely associative and folkloristic color name üìç of coalitions to mention the party names?!

Just because the coalising parties, with the exception of the FDP, have committed themselves to X-arbitrariness under Merkel's flag, you probably don't have to sort them according to colors like building blocks.

A chancellor who documents her respective coalition skills with her jacket colors does so only because she loves the rough simplification. 

Worst of the worst: 
In several press photos, you can see that her epigonin, the party chairman and the Minister of Defense during her subsequent internship with the color scheme
is fitted. Often in a more pale color gradation.

This is not a joke, but a ‚Äústuff‚Äù collection for a doctoral thesis
with the title:

‚ÄúFrom party spectrum to colour spectrum‚Äù

 Subtitles: 
 Dedifferentiation and banalisation of the parties in the Federal Republic since 2005."
"111","NEUTRAL","There are not only color associations. The coalition of the SPD and the CDU is commonly called the ‚Äúgrand coalition‚Äù. Apart from that, the parties are clearly assigned to the colours and concepts such as Jamaica or Kenya are therefore quite understandable. The three coalition partners were also mentioned in the article."
"112","NEUTRAL","The parties in the coalition associations in the FRG could, after all, relinquish their original party affiliation and establish a joint party with the coalition partners, because they basically serve a new and also a common political direction in the Community!"
"113","NEUTRAL","Uhhh neeee..."
"114","NEGATIVE","The term KENYA is used up and down, that you don't like to hear it anymore. It is the description for a trio, whereby the junior partners cdu and green together do not come to the afd result. The spd and cdu have achieved the worst result in their history and are still in government. Not to speak of the left punished by the voter."
"115","NEUTRAL","Yes, Andreas and what is your solution to the coalition problem? Do not rule at all, as the FDP saw this as a solution at the last BTW? Their mention of the election result of the left and the disastrous cutting off of the SPD and the CDU and their calculation with the AfD do not solve the problem that a government coalition must exist..."
"116","POSITIVE","Beautifully colourful."
"117","NEGATIVE","Yo, at least ebbes..."
"118","POSITIVE","Good decision for Brandenburg. A stable government without extremists. And with green economic policy, Brandenburg will create even more economic coups like Tesla. Good luck."
"119","POSITIVE","Yes, luck will be needed by the people of Brandenburg. But ‚Äústable government‚Äù, that's already a laugh."
"120","POSITIVE","You can't scare the voters even more. Nor do you need to be a calculator in order to dream of a broad agreement with the Greens, with a voter turnout of just over 50%, so the vote shrinks to below 45%. But only on the verge. 
Anyone who knows the color circle knows that everything mixed in colors turns to brown at the end. Apparently, blue would still be the better choice."
"121","NEUTRAL","Which voter was ‚Äúscorned‚Äù? It was clear before the election that there will probably be a tripartite alliance. And votes or elections in democratic systems take place in such a way that only votes cast can be counted. In the votes cast, 90.8 percent of the Green members in Brandenburg were in favour of the coalition. A very clear vote in favour of this."
"122","NEUTRAL","The CDU has become unselectable for me as a worker and taxpayer!"
"123","NEUTRAL","large employers have also already partially frozen the party donations..."
"124","NEUTRAL","And someone wants to tell me that the CDU didn't slip to the left. A shame how this party has developed in recent years."
"125","NEUTRAL","The CDU in Brandenburg has always been a bit more liberal."
"126","NEUTRAL","Hopefully there will be the Ukraine coalition in 2021. Sweden coalition would go too."
"127","MIXED","As long as there is no blue, everything is ok"
"128","NEUTRAL","Why should you still choose the CDU when you end up with a coalition with the green?"
"129","NEUTRAL","A CDU voter elects the CDU to support the CDU's electoral program with his voice. With which parties a party that does not have 50 percent of the votes and can rule alone will go into a coalition after the election depends on many factors. Because of fear of the wrong coalition partner, perhaps not to rule at all (like the FDP), every voter such a party is in fact a reason not to vote it again, because then 0% of the program will be implemented. In a coalition with, no matter who, it might only be 60 percent. Whether the coalition partner is red, yellow or green, it doesn't matter. 
there must be a majority behind it. Then compromises must be made in terms of content, since different parties logically have different programmes."
"130","NEUTRAL","a very large GROKO also,

Minority government, which must seek a majority for everything, then the right debates will finally come to the table! 
so here 4 parties just split up the cake to get their posts

‚Äî and because you are a so-called coallition, so soft debates ‚Äî you are obliged to the coalition partner ‚Äî 

is my opinion"
"131","NEUTRAL","What four parties do you mean? The coalition, at least, consists of only three parties.
Why you are advocating a minority government that can prevail even less than a majority coalition will surely remain its secret..."
"132","NEUTRAL","No matter what you choose, you always get the soup right away. Germany's democracy on the ground."
"133","NEGATIVE","NO! NO! It doesn't matter, with the AfD you would choose a different policy."
"134","NEGATIVE","With these gimmicks you won't get me back as a voter and since I want something else, only the alternative remains."
"135","NEUTRAL","The CDU goes to bed with everyone - the main thing is to get to the troughs. But it's nice to see that everyone who has been saying for a long time that the CDU has moved too much to the left, which is often denied by the media. 

CDU is not even a gossip from what she once was. Merkel has become the gravedigger of a conservative party. Center/right was once. CDU just as unselectable as all other established parties."
"136","POSITIVE","right, but AM has never been alone, and its members have always supported all the decisions."
"137","NEUTRAL","Well, then the way is clear for the first and most important government business in the whole legislature: order a company car at Tesla... :D"
"138","POSITIVE","That's what the voter did not want, God protect us"
"139","NEUTRAL","Are you the voter? But don't worry. It's fine."
"140","NEGATIVE","It is a pity that the AFD, as the second strongest force in the country, is not involved in the government. The AFD is firmly rooted in the Brandenburg population. Especially in the municipalities of Uckermark and Lusatia. The AFD is the only party that politically rejects the energy transition in Brandenburg. That would have been good for the lignite and the power plants. One can only hope that the AFD plays an important role in the Parliament."
"141","NEUTRAL","Apendix
‚ÄúThe AFD is the only party that politically rejects the energy transition in Brandenburg.‚Äù
That's not true. I watched the show of the ‚Äútop politicians‚Äù. From the AFD came the step-by-step proposal. From another candidate of the SPD? the subsidies came into play. That's where the bear's fur has already been distributed. An objection from a young spectator to the AFD: ‚ÄúYes do you want to renounce the billions?‚Äù"
"142","NEUTRAL","And if it is no longer enough after the next election, comes ‚Äúred-dark-red-black-green‚Äù and maybe even a praese yellow. The so-called EP (Unity Party).

Hm... seems kind of familiar."
"143","POSITIVE","The ‚Äúpraise‚Äù is a pinch!"
"144","NEGATIVE","Unfortunately, the parties have become too arbitrary. Each party can, apparently, with anybody - except the AfD, and sometimes the left."
"145","NEUTRAL","Again it is true that the CDU has become a party rumbled to the left. A conservative, this party can no longer elect and must seek a new political home. It still works with the prevention coalisations but how long does it go well. I regret that the CDU now wants to form a government that really resists any conservative will. Too bad about this decision in Brandenburg."
"146","NEGATIVE","Unfortunately, I can only agree. I feel the same way."
