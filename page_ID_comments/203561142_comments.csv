"1","POSITIVE","Na, dear AKK, under Mrs. Merkel and her defense ministers to UVDL/ Suder/ Tauber, it seemed almost no matter what will happen with NATO!! Because NATO lived on the fact that its member countries provide troop associations. Especially, as big nations as the FRG, with its economic power and 80 million inhabitants in their backs! Germany, could easily afford a higher deed. 55-60 billion euros, maximum. The federal government has again made billions of surpluses. And before I invent a more meaningless building child benefit, I would have put a large part of the money in the Bundeswehr. The former Bundeswehr has been miserably positioned and the European NATO member states have also severely dismantled their armed forces. Just not as radical as it happened under Mrs. Merkel. See Realignment Plans, the last one in 2011. BW's troops were 300,000 in 2000, and at times under Mrs. Merkel's leadership it was under 180,000. The number of the BIG device was capped, (not even 2 tank divisions could be fully equipped, with the few working Leo II tanks, 244 there were. There were 2,500 leopards). Everything or much should be privatized. See former State Secretary Suder (FDP) and a non-content CDU/CSU who participated in the crushing course. This Bundeswehr needs to grow urgently, not as big as it was in the summer of 89, but, at least, you should reach the force of France and Great Britain!!"
"2","NEUTRAL","“This Bundeswehr needs to grow urgently,”
Where do they get the recruits? There is hardly enough to keep the current strength."
"3","NEUTRAL","Do I alone have the impression that this woman has the ability to say as little as possible with as many words as possible? While this ability may be conducive to a career in politics, it is also the opposite of style. 

In such overwhelming vocabulary, I usually turn off in the first third of the text. 

@ Welt: how about a summary with such a bun?"
"4","NEGATIVE","“It is not a matter of survey values now, but of the concrete results that we achieved at the end of the parliamentary term.”
Fake news! That's not true. Politicians are always concerned with the survey values. That's what they measure each week."
"5","NEUTRAL","With the strengthening of NATO, Mrs AKK is doing much more for the cohesion of the EU states than Mr Macron seems to be aware of. The security concerns of our friends in Poland, the Baltic States and the Czech Republic and their fear of Russia must be taken seriously. An EU army under France's graces will speed up the conflict. Not to mention who wants to join this alliance at all."
"6","NEUTRAL","@Wolfgang J.
AKK strengthens NATO for the time being only by words, not by deeds. A strong BW with the ability to defend its territory efficiently, effectively and sustainably would be a reinforcement of NATO implemented."
"7","NEUTRAL","Akk cannot make it right to everyone party leader and Minister of Defence at two weddings, but that must be put aside when the Bundeswehr is a priority for them and their comrades see it differently, you are already in the tide."
"8","POSITIVE","So here AKK raises more questions than she asked. First, why does she come up with the clarifications of her opinion (!) not early, maybe the members have a different perspective? Secondly, since when does a democratic party have a boss or boss? She is the chairman of 400,000 formally like-minded people! Their task is first to ascertain the views of the members on current problems, to collect and present information on them, then to enter into discussions, because of me already offers solutions. But on a BPT you can only agree what was discussed before. The CO2 tax had no one discussed Third, since 1945, no German government, unlike all other countries, has defined its interests. What are they? Determined by Allierte until 1990, then not married. The Chancellor, at least, her Foreign Minister, should clearly define where the “red line” exists. But that ends beteits where the ownership of each country is undisputed: at national borders."
"9","NEUTRAL","Nato is as obsolete as AKK."
"10","NEUTRAL","Yeah, that's what Putin wants."
"11","NEUTRAL","“Strong middle doesn't mean looking for only the smallest common denominator, dwarf yourself, withdraw and say: As long as I don't notice, I'm in the middle. “
But that's exactly the problem of the CDU. It has no ideas, runs programmatically after the SPD and the Greens and stands out due to incompetence, breaches of law and whining.
Once upon a time, the CDU stood for an intact and functioning infrastructure, issues of general interest were a concern for it, education was filled with content and a popular pupil could read, write and count after 9 years, they knew Germany and Europe's history, had a realistic idea of their own life, adapted to the company and were used in many ways. The middle school and the high school expanded the knowledge and high school graduates were ready to study.
Today, more and more money is being put into education, only the results are sad.
The brand “Made in Germany” was once reputable and valuable.
As a citizen, you could rely on the state!
It was not argued by “middle”, “right” or “left” but by “right” or “wrong”. Politicians still had their own opinion and did not hide under the skirt of AKK or AM.
When you listen to AKK or AM, you only come to mind: She only talks and doesn't say anything."
"12","NEUTRAL","1303of1543_17-11-2019_ 15:46 _UTC
WORLD ON SUNDAY: French President Macron calls Nato “brain-dead”. Doesn't it need a German answer?.. WORLD ON SUNDAY: Is Macron not really about leading Europe militarily and politically? (*1)

*1: The one European army in a European Union (consisting of cooperating European nation-states linked to the European Unification Treaties) is unlikely to exist. And even “the Euroland” is not a single nation state, but a federalist community of states.

What there could be would be an intermediate solution. 

Harmonized, unified weapons systems of all European states represented in NATO and a common European General Staff, which, as the “European Central Command”, coordinates and bundles the capabilities of all European NATO sub-armed forces independent of the Pentagon.

Mr Macron may recall the military tradition of a Napoleon Bonaparte, but the Germans, among other things, should not agree with them as transatlantics, since NATO remains indispensable as a military part of the entire West."
"13","NEUTRAL","NATO is and was an appendix of American foreign policy. That is why the French said goodbye even under De Gaulle and returned only 10 years ago. However, this option never existed for Germany as a two-time war loser and due to its particular geographical location. Under Trump, we now have a completely different position of US foreign policy. The American century is coming to an end and the US is withdrawing from everything after Trump's doctrine. His successors will not reverse that, especially since I assume Trump will be re-elected anyway. 
Germany has long been using direct dialogue with Russia independently for a long time, which the Americans under Obama have already disappointed, but there is no other solution to maintain peace in Europe and to reach consensus for non-European conflicts. Germany must be interested in Europe's strength with France, but without giving up its openness to foreign policy. 
Macron is also right in the Nato case, because Europe must concentrate on itself militarily. Trump once again made it clear during the visit to Erdogan that he does not consider China, Russia and, most importantly, not Turkey dangerous, but Europe, specifically the EU and especially Germany, to the delight of the Turkish President. Likewise, Trump's expressions of sympathy for North Korea's Kim Yong Un are not exactly in the sense of NATO Member States. 
France is simply more realistic in foreign policy, and the position of strength is closer there. If Europe is not to break up completely politically and economically, Macron will only be able to join Macron's course."
"14","NEUTRAL","@Stefan
You're right. NATO is a relic of the Cold War and becomes obsolete.
Macron has a better approach to Europe's foreign and defence policy.
In recent years, Germany has lost its chance to play a leading role in European foreign policy. There have been too much wrong decisions over the past 13 years."
"15","NEGATIVE","“There is nothing in the world to give the impression that you only use such an office to make the next leap into the next state office. That would be absolutely fatal.” 

This IS absolutely fatal: AKK begins to burst politically - if the CDU does not drop it in time, the party's expectancy to the chancellery for at least two electoral periods immediately burns.
The CDU leader should take this into account and accept that her political abilities outside the province are fatal “sub limite”: from trimo Annegret - before the “Merz Revolution” sweeps through the party headquarters. :p"
"16","NEUTRAL","AKK is absolutely right on this point. It's Macron's idea to turn away from NATO. The EU is far too divided to command its own army. It would be better to stand up for a reform of NATO and finally to leave Turkey from the alliance."
"17","POSITIVE","“WELT AM SUNDAY: Has your relationship with the Chancellor changed during your year as chairman?
Kramp-Carrenbauer: It is a good and close relationship. On some points, it has become even narrower. “

Dear Mr. Alexander and Schuster,

Both of you belong to the top journalistic staff of what THE WORLD has to offer. With this interview, they offer Ms. AKK a platform that is ideally suited for her to conduct media advertising on her own behalf and in the run-up to the CDU Party Congress.

Now it is part of journalistic tools to ask unpleasant questions or to question answers stubbornly.

Why don't you ask the question in AKK's answer above: “Our readers still do not know what the Chancellor has not led her to take Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer in her government aircraft to NY and they were forced to take another plane to fly to the United States. This is still completely incomprehensible because of the climate debate and the cost of savings. “

Was this just a missed opportunity? Because this is part of quality journalism, there are no differences in opinion?

Best regards
You
Hartmut Olffers"
"18","POSITIVE","in fact, a very benevolent interview.Also questions about the expansion of military operations in the Indo-Pacific would have been interesting. But perhaps she concretizes her military dreams at the CDU Party Congress."
"19","NEUTRAL","“That's why I said, this is the boss thing.”

But the vast majority in the country doesn't want you to do that. Because the majority believe you can't. Nor could you Chancellor, Mrs. Kramp-Karrenbauer."
"20","NEUTRAL","If you allow, another small addition. I hope that you will be able to get through, for the party and for the country, to support Friedrich Merz on his way to become Chancellor."
"21","POSITIVE","I like Mrs AKK when she speaks plainly and does not like other politicians around hot issues, according to the motto 'just don't push a voter in front of the head'. It is time for the voters to be declared responsible and the problems to be ruthlessly addressed. Only in this way and together we can get through the problem jungle."
"22","NEUTRAL","It would be interesting whether the CDU party leader fully supports the plans of Horst Seehofer's Ministry of Interior (CSU) for comprehensive reform of the Europe-wide asylum system. With a preliminary examination directly at the EU external border — and measures against unauthorized travel. According to the WELT AM SUNDAY key points paper, “accommodation and social benefits” would be granted “exclusively in the competent Member State”.

Anyone who travels to another country and lodged another asylum application should be rejected as “obviously unfounded” and should quickly be transferred to the competent state without any action."
"23","NEGATIVE","K-K always seems like a speech doll, which has been put in slogans and phrases."
"24","NEUTRAL","Mrs Baerbock feels more like that. Like a slob doll."
"25","NEUTRAL","“Macron wants to replace Nato. We want to strengthen them”
She may be right about what she says, but is it really wise and diplomatic to address things so openly and to snuff France? It seems to me that there's just another little bit on her way."
"26","NEGATIVE","Snuck France? But France, Germany draws over the table? See “joint” armor projects and now Airbus, oh miracle, wants to try to prevent Germany buying a US aircraft model as Panavia Tornado replacement. Who else is in charge of Airbus and who is putting their interests into place? Think about it? France or Germany? And how, could you snuck France? France, at least more defensive than Germany, since the 2000s and France, will not waste its nuclear power on Germany or the EU. Germany, has abandoned its defensive ability and then wanted or not supplemented some nonsensical arms projects. See Eurocopter Tiger, an almost pure tank hunter, but hardly suitable for asssymmetric warfare. There is missing the French tiger model in the Bundeswehr with the movable onboard cannon. Or, it's missing another guy who has a similar armament to the Apache. If you want to drive worldwide missions, like our AKK, you need several model models instead of focusing all the skills on 1 model. As long as Germany can go over the table and learns nothing from its arms projects, the EU's defence capability is dismissed. Because, in Mali, you were at first, only at the request of France and not out of German interest."
"27","NEGATIVE","Even after this interview, I do not have the impression that Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer really knows what she is talking about. It also never gives the impression that it is actually aware of the importance of federal policy. It seems to play a role without perceiving connections and requirements at all, let alone recognizing and being able to plan and act purposefully. She's a purely speech doll. I'm horrible!"
"28","POSITIVE","Good and courageous that people with AKK say clearly what the SPD foreign politicians can't do. Macron's ideas don't fit into reality and that needs to be addressed."
"29","NEUTRAL","Macron's view that without NATO under the leadership of the US, EU Europe would have any strategic options is fundamentally wrong - illusory and not at all desirable. As a German, you can explicitly contradict or you can draw a positive picture as it should be. In any case, in the German interest it must be avoided that anyone in the CDU/CSU or in the government in Germany would see other strategic options than NATO under the US leadership in the coming decades. Better, it should be said again more often.
The basis of almost 75 years of peace in Germany and most of Europe is the Western bond, democracy and market economy in Germany under the strategic umbrella of NATO under the leadership of the US.
The Franco-German friendship and the EU have also been achieved, in addition to the will of the parties involved, mainly through this factor and not vice versa or independently of it.
It must be designed in this context, but it must not be injured. Thanks to its icons from Adenauer, Erhard and Strauss to Kohl, the CDU/CSU has been a decisive designer and guarantor of this peace order, which must be defended against pacifists, Russians and other dream dancers to this day. There must be more from a “renewed” CDU if a French President makes such a statement. This is not a gradual difference - this is the completely wrong direction."
"30","NEUTRAL","A very interesting statement. But for my taste, the word “was” comes too often. Isn't fundamental change the challenge of responding with new strategies? If Germany describes the picture of the successful past of the past 70 years, does this mean that the (formerly) allies see it as well? Has Germany's lack of solidarity with NATO undermined this shield? Preaching help from the US and doing gas business with Russia against the interests of the allies - that would not have existed among any of the mentioned politicians from Adenauer to Kohl. Merkel now also wants to promote China (Huawei) in the German market of technologies already begun. No! No! As a Nato partner, I would keep a very critical eye on it and say that Merkel's policy does NOT fit into the once successful alliance policy. Short-term economic interests hardly provide reliable alliances."
"31","NEUTRAL","AKK: The French are striving for strong European cooperation to replace NATO. On the other hand, I am talking about 'A2A', that is, 'ability to act', the ability to act. I am concerned that any strengthening of European defence also strengthens the European pillar of NATO.

Dear Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer, I see that too. In addition, the French also want to approach Russia. All this may make sense for France and is also in French tradition, but for Germany and our Eastern European EU neighbours it carries considerable risks. But as it happens, it will be necessary that the capabilities of the Bundeswehr will be significantly improved. And it costs money. I guess that there is in the population 
currently there is no majority for more money for the military. This means that you must do a lot of persuasion, also because of the omissions of those responsible so far. Your survey readings will go down again and again. You have to go through there. I'll keep my fingers crossed for you."
"32","NEUTRAL","WELT asks whether Germany's military should go on a robust terrorist hunt in the future. And Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer does not share her own specific opinion, but only wants to have another public debate. A debate will always give different perspectives, but I believe that a party leader must set a concrete conviction and direction."
"33","NEUTRAL","The Bundeswehr is in a miserable state. Which hybris does German politics think they want to prescribe something to anyone with.

Above all, we have to agree on the same thing we want to achieve with BW. With an annual budget of almost EUR 45 billion, the current strategy of providing a few thousand men as crisis intervention forces and command units and drilling a well sometimes somewhere in the desert is simply too little.

For this, the apparatus BW is too oversized."
"34","NEUTRAL","Well, Finland, with its strong, operational army, is the guarantor of “peace” in the east. The small country has more soldiers under arms (280,000) than today's Bundeswehr. Turkey and the Mediterranean countries are helping on the refugee issue, and in Germany people are happy about the black zero, while German savers are upset that Germany is supposedly paying for everyone. Well, if you look at Germany from the outside, you probably hardly want this country as an alliance partner."
"35","NEGATIVE","The best question is “The CDU never adhered to its own program. So why should anyone else be interested in your programme debate? “
And Mrs Kramp-Karrenbauer, unfortunately, did not give me a convincing answer. 

As a last such disappointment, I remember the CDU Chancellor's rejection of the abolition of the unjust double sickness insurance contributions for occupational pensioners despite the decision to the contrary."
"36","NEGATIVE","The opposition needs strong leadership. There is no doubt that the chairman is well positioned for this."
"37","NEUTRAL","The big questions of the future, this CDU clarifies But to the detriment of the population and less, in that sense!! I am actually less a growler, but just as Mrs Merkel leads the country, or leads it less, much has gone to his disadvantage. Mrs. Merkel, has managed to stay in power. She repeatedly found paladins that led her through crises. In the financial crisis, it was Mr Steinbrück, without him Mrs Merkel would have been sling. Then came the strengthened FDP, which could barely run before force... Then came the Groko, vicarious agents. While the CDU continues to give up topics and give up. Mrs Merkel supported politicians beside her who criticised nothing. Those who criticized were sitting in the second row when they were. Except for one exception: Jens Spahn. She then appointed this minister because the pressure became too great. She could also have appointed Mr Bosbach as Minister or Mr Roderich Kiesewetter, Colonel A.D. But such gentlemen had too much backbone. But people like Mr. Tauber needed. Altmaier, who helped to weaken Germany's position! The FDP helped with its (privatisation) course, see the Bundeswehr or the NPP operators in a better position to be able to sue Germany. In addition, there was a massive dismantling of police and justice until a few years ago. So, also Halle could happen, as there were no police patrol in front of the synagogue, which could have been parked Pro Forma, there. At least, “maybe” only one policeman would have lost his life but no civilians. A willing, disagreeable, disputed SPD helps the chancellor stay in power. Questions of the future will be tackled, such as the solos, land tax but how!? At the property tax, you have to see what will come out of it, at the solos, the last 10% remain even though you promised to end it! In addition, there was an agreement on national financial compensation, where question marks have to be put."
"38","NEUTRAL","In summary, one can say: power instead of making."
"39","NEUTRAL","420 years ago, Shakespeare wrote “A lot of noise for nothing”. It's a comedy. However, this interview, which would tolerate this title, is a tragedy. 

p.s. My admiration for the two colleagues who conducted the interview and, despite the answers, held it up to the end. 

Another p.s.: The sentence “in the moment where...” could also be written by Lothar Matthew."
"40","POSITIVE","Mrs Kramp Karrenbauer has put important things in motion. She got a lot of beating for that, and she deserves respect. Keep going, Mrs. Kramp Karrenbauer."
"41","NEUTRAL","The Union lacks a combative leadership which, in view of the dramatic crash in recent years, has a firm will to fundamentally transform the party. However, this cannot be seen under AKK; it is more likely to try to preempt voters with cosmetic corrections and care for the leading minds. The last election results confirm the progress of siechtism. Credibility requires new faces that also stand for the new direction, this is not true for AKK and even less for Brinkhaus."
"42","NEGATIVE","Again an interview in which the lady persistently answers no question clearly and clearly. I don't want simple answers or populist sayings, but can't they at least try to give plausible answers? This top political staff is so sucking!"
"43","NEUTRAL","“Looking at structural decisions of recent years... So why should anyone else be interested in your programme debate?
...
Kramp-Karrenbauer: It is clear that the big decisions have always been made in the breadth of the party.” 

That's a good question. And it was rather the case that these decisions were decided ad hoc in the very narrow circle and then were only nodded by CDU/CSU committees. One can add to the list above (since 2005): Equality Law 05, Schengen East without external border 06, IKB, HRE as well as Landesbanken Rescue, scrapping premiums and economic packages 07-08, Greece rescue and de-facto deletion of no-bailout clause 10 etc.
The question, of course, remains unanswered. So why programme debate?"
"44","NEUTRAL","A programme debate only makes sense if it has an open outcome. However, it seems to me that it is only used as a placebo for political participation without willingness to change."
"45","NEUTRAL","“... security policy and taking care of the Bundeswehr must be a priority...”
Following the words would be a good start!"
"46","NEGATIVE","AKK is not able to do this. This requires experience and expertise in this field. After her previous appearances, she has not revealed both.
I also doubt their skills for chancellor candidacy."
"47","NEUTRAL","Unfortunately, the EU is still too weak in military terms to be respected by China and the US. We need the United States, and we must quickly overcome Trump and hold on to NATO again. In the long term, the EU and its European partners should become a military power that corresponds to its economic and political strength. Relying on the US forever is neither fair to the US nor good for the EU. But all this will not go without solid funding."
"48","NEGATIVE","The worst thing that can happen to a ruling party is a newly elected head of government who immediately announces not to compete in the next election. Tony Blair did the same thing, and then, apparently unburdened by re-election worries, through a whole series of lone decisions, in the remaining time of government, made sure not only of his own party, but of the entire political system of his country.

Nor does Merkel seem to leave the designated successor the butter on the bread and decides as she wishes. There will only be a change in the Union, which AKK fantasizes today, when Merkel is officially adopted. It will be much more violent than you can imagine today. And if the Union still exists in its present form, it is certainly with other actors."
"49","NEGATIVE","Hopefully the meticulous actors do not completely ruin the CDU.
As the CDU represents itself, I fear the worst.
Better now would be a new start with other actors, otherwise I see more dark times coming to the CDU."
"50","NEGATIVE","There is a fled from one fairy tale to another.
A Germany that has asserted that not only its own 
boundaries are not worthy of protection, do not need to plump up
somewhere in the world to take “responsibility”.

It's no longer existent."
"51","POSITIVE","And yet you live quite well and surely in this no longer existent Germany. And it's better and more safe than ever before. And no matter how often you claim the opposite here, real numbers, and only they count, say something else."
"52","NEUTRAL","In view of the US's current foreign policy appearance, I personally believe that a healthy distrust of the so-called partnerships within NATO is quite appropriate and justified. Particularly in view of the desire for a vast empire of one of the NATO partners in the South-East of the EU, which is positioning itself through massive upgrading. And that the partnership of the current US is not to rely on, they have only recently (unfortunately) proven impressively. For this reason, I think swift reflection on the possibilities of an effective EU self-defence is urgently needed.

Russia should therefore be involved in such a reflection rather than from the point of view of a possible opponent. Without Russia, there is not much going in Europe and nothing sensible with the US. Even our immediate EU-East neighbour does not shine with EU loyalty and EU integrity and prefer to rely on the supposed “friend” USA. Whoever has such partners beyond the Atlantic and on its eastern and south-east borders deserves their real enemies."
"53","NEUTRAL","Russia does nothing but the sparse Nato partner you mean. Only with the difference that Russia has been pursuing this policy for more than 80 years."
"54","NEUTRAL","Testimony for AKK: It always strives to “work out” its tasks (coalition agreement).
Is that enough?"
"55","NEGATIVE","such a stupid stuff, NATO is nothing without the Americans, and I would not necessarily want to build on their reliability, Europeans must emancipate themselves and become a heavyweight of power politics."
"56","NEGATIVE","I see that too, it is time for the European states to concentrate on what connects them and not on what separates them. But with Merkel and Kramp-Karrenbauer this might be impossible."
"57","NEUTRAL","Kramp-Karrenbauer: “It is clear that the big decisions have always been made in the breadth of the party. “

That's just not true! “The great decisions” were made by means of “self-empowerment”. And the “reversal” of these devastating decisions is pending.

And this reversal is, first and foremost, a question with which staff at the top could succeed. That is why the question of personnel and not any “small” is in the foreground."
"58","NEUTRAL","The abbreviations in German are still in need of getting used to, for example, in English JFK sounds good.
But whenever I hear or read AKK (Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer - called AKK), I automatically think of a splinter group of a terrorist organization or a firearm. I come from Hungary and there are abbreviations for names just as funny as here, fortunately they are not often used.
Maybe as a German AKK, I would find just as cool as JFK as a Hungarian.
I won't know that in this life."
"59","NEGATIVE","I don't like that either, so much time should be to write the name out. I think this has something to do with respect."
"60","NEUTRAL","What else can you believe? This is most evident from the 2% target to NATO.
It is propagated to stick to this goal. And what we did specifically? The opposite. 
How can I choose such a party?"
"61","NEUTRAL","Strengthening NATO is not wrong, but it will no longer be able to replace an independent military option in the long term.
It would be grossly negligent to continue relying solely on NATO, but there is an increasing lack of sufficient common interest.
The other military culture, as Kramp Karrenbauer calls it, coincides with the current German state, but is about as sustainable as the Catholic Church in Germany."
"62","NEGATIVE","AKK, always the same words, always the same mimic, always the same pitch. This woman has no visions, does not have the tools to become chancellor. For a good politician, she simply lacks everything. The followers of AM are all good party soldiers. Obviously, the voter does not want exactly this one anymore. The SPD has already taken this path, the CDU is following a certain step. Before the leadership and, above all, the behavior is not changed, it continues down the mountain."
"63","NEUTRAL","At least with NATO and not like Macron with a stupid European army, probably underfunded in favour of development aid, French farmers, Romanian highways and land wind turbines. Immediately increase to 2% defense duties, own aircraft carrier, in consultation with Poland, USA and UK, and for financing all red-green swamps (“Fight against... “, Amadeu Antonio Foundation, subsidy here, subsidy there...). The West must stick together. With the Anglo-Saxons, no romantic German special routes."
"64","NEUTRAL","In defence policy, Germany is insignificant - whether in the context of NATO or the EU -. 

In conflict situations, they are more strongly still active - it rather “buys” away from its responsibility.

Nato has long been obsolete in this form. 
A milthary-pact with the Sowietunion would be responsible and would be important for development in the Middle East and as a counterpoint to increasingly dominant China.
 International territorial agreements on disputed regions in Poland on roads and extraction of raw materials must be concluded in order to prevent future conflicts."
"65","NEUTRAL","A military pact with the Soviet Union? Why not, but it would have been necessary to think about this much earlier, because as of 17.11.2019 the USSR is no longer existent."
"66","NEUTRAL","OMG what does the woman talk. Under her chancellor, the Bundeswehr was finally ruined and no longer a serious defence army. It was more and more demoscopically advantageous to leave “unsightly images”, that is, serious security policy to the allies and to shy oneself good-human-pacifist."
"67","NEGATIVE","Once again, only a continuous repeat of phrases, without a concrete target direction or vision becoming recognizable. The bending in front of the SPD regarding the need test for the basic pension and the like falls under the term “we continue to work the coalition agreement” is typical and confirms that with this CDU leadership any lazy compromise that secures one's own pillars is possible. With this pathetic staff, the party congress will continue to say goodbye, the officials will sunbathe in self-praise and the voters will hopefully finally wake up."
"68","POSITIVE","“Volker Kauder was and is absolutely loyal. That speaks for his character. 
Every debate about staff creates a great deal of unrest. Based on the current polls, we can see how it matters to citizens when a party only deals with itself. “

Wrong, Volker Kauder was and is loyal to Mrs. Merkel and her entourage, nothing else.
Maintenance of power at any cost.
You, Mrs. Kramp-Karrenbauer, can continue to “conjure up” yourself in your pocket and reinterpret the “content bankruptcy of the CDU” + overstrain + inability of the political personnel as you want, but nobody will believe you any more.
You show an incredibly disrespectful attitude towards the voter with such statements. The voter is asking for content.
To:
“the citizens” also the people of Germany”
You too often use “the citizens of Germany” in your argument as an amplifier of your personal interests."
"69","NEUTRAL","AKK is a light weight in international politics and the continuation of Germany's dejection at foreign policy level. Without a plan, without a network for it with Merkel's perseverance slogans. The opponents are looking forward to an easy game. A Merz would probably be the CDU's last chance to show strength and bring something on the chain. Or you just follow the SPD into insignificance..."
"70","NEUTRAL","That's how I see it.
Under Merkel, everything in the CDU, which did not conform to her opinion, was worsened.
The formerly very critical CSU partner Seehofer has now been softened and compliant. 
Thus, the CDU/CSU will no longer win elections."
"71","NEUTRAL","The Saarland Landrat sets the wrong priorities. Primarily we need investment in education, infrastructure and the removal of administrative regulations in the construction and manufacturing sector, combined with a tight tax relief. After that, the rest can come."
"72","POSITIVE","NATO does not actually exist anymore, see Turkey. Good morning AKK."
"73","NEGATIVE","Maceon is a leader with vision. Don't acc. We must become more independent in Europe. My opinion. The time is now ripe for this. It's a pity that we don't follow Macron's idea and continue to depend on a country from overseas (with intellectually undermined politicians)."
"74","NEUTRAL","MACRON 😄"
"75","POSITIVE","Respect that you can say so little with so many words!
If our top politicians don't think about security policy other than more money for weapons, that is already weak (which is then thrown into a barrel without ground). Mr Trittin has shown a clear edge in the mirror, among other things criticised NATO for missing disarmament initiatives, as well as the inaction of Mr Maas or a clear statement from him: military must not replace politics!"
"76","NEUTRAL","After successfully pulverizing internal security, we want to take care of security policy = Orwellian surveillance of citizens. Respect. The Chancellor implements her plan and neither ox nor donkey will stop her."
"77","NEUTRAL","AKK has been party chairman for a year now, and what has this new leadership brought to the party? Have the voters reacted positively to the change at the top? No, they do not have - all we have to do is look at the results of the election, and the survey figures are not likely to be satisfied in the Union. Critics on the Chancellor's course have no reason to remain critical through AKK. The question why to choose CDU is still unanswered. Depending on the situation, you get greens, very often social-liberal politics, you make compromises that always go to the detriment of the interests of the CDU voters. This has been taking revenge for years in decreasing voters - basically a logical consequence of this policy which AKK has been supporting for a long time. The fact that she does not miss any fat pans, her speeches do not sound credible, nor do she seem to inspire anyone to elect CDU, yes she is chairman - if the CDU were wise, one would now form a credible team and in a year Friedrich Merz becomes chancellor candidate and chairman (he is all that AKK is not, sovereign safe on topics and credible) and AKK finds in the team a task that they can complete. Chancellor can't do her."
"78","POSITIVE","@CW
... I rely (also) on insight of all involved - AKK works, no matter what she says, like a brake pad and from the number “Vole table commissioner”, she doesn't get out!
I miss absolute alertness, the ability for quick and constructive analysis, as well as the gift of sovereign manners (prerequisite: ability of independent reflection)."
"79","NEGATIVE","Mrs. AKK makes the intimidated impression of a person who (now) tries to do everything right and not say anything wrong (more).
Unfortunatly bad conditions for a leadership position. 
Healthy self-consciousness and charisma would be better."
"80","NEUTRAL","“Security policy and taking care of the Bundeswehr must be the top priority of the CDU. That's why I said, “This is the boss thing.” 
... but unfortunately not “I have no idea of this, so I use an experienced professional”..."
"81","NEUTRAL","A lot of politicians speaking in this interview without any substance.
The evidence has been available since 07.12.2018 that it cannot lead the CDU. The leadership of the country would certainly not be able to trust her. 
“A further so” with this chairman AKK and the incumbent and consumed Chancellor Merkel cannot exist. That was supposed to be the signal from Leipzig!
 But as I know the CDU, the delegates like the Lemminge will clap 10 minutes of frenetic applause there. 

And Merz? He might be making a smart speech. That's all. Tell him, whoever blows his cheeks must be able to whistle. And, in fact, be prepared to ask the chancellor and chairman question. 

Anyone who has not yet understood what has beaten the hour after Thuringia at the latest is no longer to help."
"82","NEGATIVE","Personnel discussions are especially for those who are not pleasant to the subject of discussion."
"83","POSITIVE","Sounds funny when a Saarland woman speaks English like that.
So at least my sensation 😁😁😁"
"84","NEGATIVE","“I am talking about “A2A”, that is, the “ability to act”, the ability to act”.
To speak of “A2A”, you should at least have a little idea of the English language. Mrs. Kramp doesn't have these. Even Mr. Oettinger speaks English better than her. So this just seemed embarrassing.
To take them to the word: “ability to act” requires that you maintain an army that is well equipped and can be deployed at any time. These do not include pregnancy uniforms and daycare in barracks. These include airplanes that fly (always and everywhere, even at night), rifles that shoot straight ahead, decent footwear, helicopters that can be used (everything, anytime and anywhere, even at night), submarines diving, staff who has practiced enough to carry out a mission at any time, etc. today is not the case. What Mrs. Kramp does is eyewash. The Bundeswehr is a parliamentary army and this Bundestag will certainly never give its consent for active war operations, in which there is even the slightest risk of hundreds of coffins being flown home with dead German soldiers.
All in all, Mrs Kramp is the absolutely worst possible solution as Minister of Defence, but also as leader of the party. It simply cannot and should withdraw from politics if it has the slightest sense of responsibility for Germany and the CDU."
"85","POSITIVE","What always amazes me with such interviews is the questions asked (which are usually useful), the answers given (often past the questions) and the readiness of the interviewer to let the interviewee go through this. A lot would have been achieved, dear world, if there were more plainly spoken here!"
"86","NEUTRAL","With this woman at the head, clinging to the chancellor without ife, who still sees the CDU “in the middle”, not even with the addition “conservative”, all this will be nothing. Which AFD voter should come up with the idea to say after this interview: Yes, now this party is again my interest representative. I'm going to pick CDU again."
"87","NEUTRAL","For years, no minister and certainly no Mnsteress managed to sratt the Bundeswehr as it would be necessary. What does KK want to use to expand NATO? With the further refusal no money in the defense, as contractually decided to flow to bring the state to the best. It's like kindergarten. So no one has confidence n the politict."
"88","NEGATIVE","But Mrs K already has the necessary word envelope at hand. “Ability to act”, which is a bad joke given the shortcomings in the Bundeswehr. Our troops lack the ability as a result of a missing device, and act is certainly not possible, because we are surrounded by friends and the horizon does not reach further The Slgan should be called “no ability for action”, because in the Merkelland goal and reality would finally be in tune."
"89","NEGATIVE","A lot of politicians without content. Scary to read the interview. Hope of a more conservative positioning of the CDU have dissolved into blowing. Merz is for me the last hope to prevent a nationwide AFD rise a la East Germany."
"90","POSITIVE","Macron is right, he's the right man for the EU. AKK doesn't have the format for it... away with Nato and AKK."
"91","NEGATIVE","“... then the CDU never adhered to its own program. So why should anyone else be interested in your programme debate?”
I'd go further. How can one choose a party that stands for nothing more than arbitrariness and shameless preservation of power of a single person in the chancellery?
 When AKK speaks of tradition and calls Adenauer and Kohl in a sentence with the current incumbent, I get sick. The first two Social Democratic chancellors would fit better.
Merkel and tradition fit together as well as black color and mold."
"92","NEUTRAL","What should be understood by the word “robust mandate”?"
"93","NEUTRAL","This is a technical term within the meaning of Chapter VII (Article 42) of the UN Charter. You can read on the Internet. Just enter this term."
"94","NEUTRAL","As long as Merkel is Chancellor, AKK will not be able to develop its own profile.
Your silence in the negotiations of the basic pension speaks for itself.
The Chancellor makes the guidelines.
The AKK took part in this, disqualified her.
She stands for the same way."
"95","NEUTRAL","@ Countrywoman
“Their silence in the negotiations of the basic pension speaks for itself. The Chancellor makes the guidelines. The AKK took part in this, disqualified her. “

I see the same way.
Here she could have shown profile (I had hoped), but Mrs. Kramp-Karrenbauer is a very weak leader similarity.
As a chancellor candidate, she wouldn't get my vote."
