"1","NEGATIVE","the introduction of benefits in kind, instead of cash for transfers to the home, would not allow this problem to arise or minimize, for catering vouchers, no one changes the country."
"2","NEUTRAL","Mrs Merkel has so far allowed entry and onward travel for everyone, why should you change this policy shortly before the end of the chancellor? an air castle Herr Seehofer, but unfortunately real."
"3","NEUTRAL","I hear the message of bringing about effective European solutions to mitigate migration here... Alone, I don't have faith now. 

It is, moreover, good to refer to Europe if the limitation of irregular immigration is not achieved in your own country (despite existing legal instruments from GG and AsylG)."
"4","NEUTRAL","He cannot prevent Africans from entering.

In September 2019, the majority of the EU Parliament adopted a resolution on the “Fundamental Rights of People of African descent in Europe”. And this principle decision is far-reaching: it is not just the need for strategies to allow Africans to enter the EU in a safe and legal way. Numerous educational and support measures are also required by the EU member states.

One statement of principle reads: “People of African descent have contributed significantly throughout history to the building of European society.” Contrary to all historical realities, such claims derives an obligation of Europeans to welcome people from Africa indefinitely in Europe."
"5","NEGATIVE","Neither the wording nor the intention behind it is to me understandable."
"6","NEUTRAL","There are no majorities in Germany for changes in asylum policy, even the majority of the population still vote left and green. So many economic migrants will come and turn the social system upside down."
"7","NEUTRAL","The statements of Mr. Seehofer are the whistling in the forest. He knows well that there will never be such a regulation in the EU, because in such a case he will never get a majority for it, both in the EU and not in Germany. The affected EU countries are glad that Germany is so generous and that the migrants are getting rid of. There are certainly two parties in Germany that would oppose it. So hot air again."
"8","NEGATIVE","That's kind of nonsense. After all, a court has just ruled that it violates human dignity by reducing the benefits too much for Hartz 4 recipients who are unwilling to work. Ergo must be fed to EVERYONE who is staying here at the end. How are we going to cut the money for migrants now? That has 0 prospects of success."
"9","NEGATIVE","Does anyone really think that this is ever coming or actually being implemented?!"
"10","NEUTRAL","Seehofer: unauthorized onward journey SHOW! Typical hot air as always."
"11","POSITIVE","Simply abolish the all-round supply and is good. Pocket money for charitable work. But with all the left Green and Special Democrats, nothing can be done."
"12","MIXED","Better late than never, that's how it should have been done right from the start.
Unfortunately, I do not think that this new regulation will make it into practice. Hollow phrases, empty promises, substantive announcements... the usual.
The migration extremists are already in the starting blocks, and they will make sure that there are still a few dozen loopholes for illegal immigrants."
"13","NEUTRAL","Merkel has opened the box of the Pandora, every inhabitant of the earth knows that Germany's borders are open, even without papers a social holiday is possible. Now we can clearly feel the cost of this insanity. Only fortune knights and social freakers come to Europe by 90%. The right-wing parties are successful not only in Italy, France, Poland and Germany. Whether Seehofer will succeed this time is to be doubted, because the Greens, the SPD and the Left still do not want to recognize the seriousness of the situation. Apart from that who should implement Seehofer's project? Frontex? 
Perhaps Seehofer will find a partner Macron, who is currently moving to the right."
"14","NEGATIVE","In view of the prevailing legal view, how should this be implemented?
If someone, then unjustified, is here, we must not leave him unsupplied, but a return to the first receiving country would be deportation, I'm afraid.
All just announcements without prospect of feasibility. The will is missing!"
"15","NEUTRAL","It can also be said: if the EU fails to solve the migration problem in such a way that extremist currents do not get any further influx and our existing democratic system “does not get out of the slats”, then it can only be advisable if each Member State, apart from the most important and long-overdue, effective external border management by the EU, taking its own precautions."
"16","NEUTRAL","Simply apply applicable law, then there is no need for new laws."
"17","NEGATIVE","Without changing the law, it will not work. Thanks to European asylum law, an asylum seeker can complain through all instances, which takes years. If he is then deported, which in the least of cases succeeds, he only has to reach European soil again in order to submit another asylum application with a different grant. Then the game starts from the beginning. There is no upper limit for asylum applications."
"18","NEGATIVE","I do not believe it until this is effectively implemented in reality."
"19","NEUTRAL","As long as all parties in Germany disagree on combating illegal entry, as long as the Greens, the Left and the SPD want to welcome everyone in Germany, there will be no common way in the EU against the refugee movement and, above all, the onward journey within the EU towards Germany, the External borders of the EU are holey like a Swiss cheese and you just have to look at who is allegedly persecuted, young men who say in every interview that Europe has money and everything else, as long as this opinion prevails, the influx is not stopped and Europe is flooded by migrants, here Europe should finally have to be Campaigns start and do so on the ground in the countries that are getting on the way, Mr Seehofer's proposal is good when Germany and the EU are pulling together, otherwise it was again just a well-intentioned proposal which is stifled into germs."
"20","NEUTRAL","Mr Seehofer can be calmly called Mr Meier on the basis of his previous statements and the subsequent actions. 

As always, hot air and nothing gets around in the end. 

The question will again be what measures the “national force act” will then be suspended again by courts because they are not based on clean “craftsmanship”."
"21","NEGATIVE","Even if it were applicable law, it would also have to be applied. As it is so far, this would be just a paper tiger."
"22","NEGATIVE","Again, the old problem is that Member States are obliged to accept refugees in terms of size and economic performance. This can't work. States involved in the destruction or exploitation of the countries of origin should take in the refugees; Germany cannot prescribe a country to whom it must accept."
"23","NEUTRAL","Illegal entry should also lead to the exclusion of social benefits. This would save Germany many billions of euros."
"24","NEGATIVE","Better than nothing, but in view of the damage already done, it is inevitably possible to ask: why not now? Why four years of idleness and standstill? Why these tripple steps in the topic of migration? Why don't we take the lead as the most affected country, as we do in terms of environment and climate?
For comparison, when it comes to climate hysteria, it took only half a year from Greta's seated strike in Sweden to a climate law in Germany... The main thing is to shout loud enough, the right images/emotions... and the “right” political attitude, then it goes faster. The role of the media is a crucial..."
"25","NEGATIVE","It would bring more to the state if asylum seekers who have been legally rejected were cancelled the social benefits!

These mistakes in migration policy make the patience of the majority of the population finally come to an end."
"26","NEUTRAL","“... for a reform of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS)...”

Until now, it was only German courts that had discarded everything.
From the minimum level of social benefits to the prohibition of return to Italy or Greece.
A reform would have to start here - starting with the Basic Law.

What does Europe have to do with it?
Right, nothing!"
"27","NEGATIVE","It is not the basic law that is the problem, but the politically motivated deliberate misinterpretation of it."
"28","NEGATIVE","Sounds like a meaningful plan. This ensures that it will not be implemented."
"29","NEGATIVE","“Unauthorised onward travel should lead to exclusion of social benefits”

Isn't that a practice that has not been practiced yet? If not, then this is an incredible waste of our taxpayers' money."
"30","MIXED","Unfortunately, I don't believe in the whole circus anymore! If one assumes that nothing is left to chance in politics and knows the political events of 2014/15, one must assume the desired migration and intention. Suitable for reading the - Internet search - 
'European Parliament resolution on the fundamental rights of people of African descent in Europe'
Now there are good things to read, but the wanted migration of Africans is clear political will in the EU! This goes up to non-historical statements such as in point O. “whereas in the course of history people of African descent have contributed significantly to the construction of European society...” All this is very influenced by the left-wing zeitgeist, one-sided and often very unrealistic. Points G, K, the evil police at L, point 3 - the duty to include, but 4 also applies to Europeans? , points 5 and 6! 7 and 13 for guilty conscience and taxpayers' money. Point 11 for opinion framing. At 26, there's money for the NGOs.

Finally, point 23. “calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that migrants, refugees and asylum seekers can enter the EU in a safe and legal manner, taking into account existing legislation and procedures;”

Anyone who cannot recognize the political will for migration is to blame himself!"
"31","NEGATIVE","Mumpitz! If the test is negative, then migrants will remain in the countries of arrival Italy, Greece and Spain, because they cannot be transported back. These countries will hardly agree with this. So it's going on as before."
"32","POSITIVE","Beautiful saying Presse Aktiv only the constitutional judges will collect this right away!
a the right to asylum in the German area of law! b the duties of supply from the basic!
So we do not need Mr Seehofer sayings from all AFD!"
"33","POSITIVE","The flat-rate disparaging of those seeking protection as social disgusting who are read everywhere is already bordered by incitement. It is better to see the opportunities and diversity that migrants bring to our dusty society."
"34","POSITIVE","Sweet, I'm just looking for a humidifier, preferably an evaporator that evaporates water. I will search for the model “Horst Seehofer” or CDU/CSU on Amazon. These should be the best when it comes to producing hot air...! And until the picture in this country has changed again, as an old CDU voter, I will choose the only alternative..."
"35","NEUTRAL","It would help tremendously if politicians understood that not “Europe” or the EU is the magnet, but unfortunately only Germany. Once you understood this, the rest is simple. Whether a solution can come up with is a completely different question."
"36","NEGATIVE","You have to let it melt on your tongue. Only now will there be no social benefits for “unauthorized onward travel”. That should have been done by now. Why does Germany not push this rigorously in the EU with pressure!!!. Mrs. Merkel took up a million refugees in 2015 and was unable to distribute them any more (went wrong). So the FRG should have acted vigorously at least in the case of blatant possibilities of abuse, which does not happen. In addition, the Greens will soon be in power at federal level and will continue to block real state power. So we continue to live in times of wanted state incapacity for action. Figures are not the Greens, but we taxpayers. - International Law Research"
"37","NEGATIVE","I hear the message, but I do not have faith!"
"38","NEUTRAL","You should learn from the Danes.
'The term 'integration' is replaced by 'self-sufficiency and home'. The bureaucratic word structure conceals nothing more than a clear tightening of immigration laws. Refugees should know from the outset that Denmark is not becoming their new home. “Honesty” is what Stojberg calls. - Handelsblatt”"
"39","NEUTRAL","Great further intrusion of the “Enforcement Minister”.
Guaranteed to come around 2039, when this country in its previous form and as you used to know it, is no longer available.
There is also talk of 'European solution' in this context."
"40","POSITIVE","I don't think until it's definitely handled this way..."
"41","MIXED","Good ideas, but let's see if this can be realized. Because as long as D is so generous in maintenance, it will be magnet number 1."
"42","NEUTRAL","There is no relusion to the other EU states, either Germany does this alone, or everything remains the same."
"43","NEUTRAL","Such a fancy would be unthinkable in the United States. There has long since been a Ministry of Homeland Security and illegal migrants have not to expect financially."
"44","NEGATIVE","I think that with an uncontrolled entrance to Germany, hardly any citizen in D can approve. Even Mrs. Merkel doesn't. You don't have to be an AfD voter to say that this goes too far. But we must not let ourselves be tempted to violate the law and the law. But one has the opportunity to protest against it and it doesn't have to be called AfD either."
"45","NEUTRAL","Or you finally change the laws"
"46","NEGATIVE","At that time, we were sold the euro, that no country is liable for someone else's debts. And now?
At that time, the removal of border controls in Germany was sold to us by the fact that border controls take place just as well at the EU's external borders. And now?
The words of politicians are not worth the paper they are printed on.
Mr Seehofer's announcements are, as always, just a placebo. Neither enforceable with the other European partners, nor with the coalition partner SPD, nor with the opposition from the Greens and the Left.
It would be better to keep him silent!"
"47","NEUTRAL","Has the external border countries also been given financial support at that time for them to carry their work alone, while the landlocked countries save money and no longer control?"
"48","NEGATIVE","What is the difference from the current legal situation? 

Anyone coming from a safe third country MUST (and NOT CAN) be rejected at the border. 
His grounds for asylum are void here.

That's the legal situation.

And is not the country of first entry already responsible for the asylum application?

So if this is a trick by Seehofer with which he can return to the practice of current law and at the same time disguised,
that previously applicable law was violated with anyone who entered German soil from a safe third country?"
"49","NEUTRAL","in the approach a good consideration - will not be implemented. Except D, all have long ceased (or did not start at all) to flood their country alongside really asylum seekers with tons of sham asylum seekers who only want to come here because of the generous benefits. Where in the world is there full life care for anyone who can take the step across the border and pronounce the word asylum? 
Only an EU-wide alignment of social benefits along basic services would at least slow down the pull factors. A further decisive step would indeed be the consistent examination of the right to asylum at the external borders of the EU. At the same time, the legal path to the EU could be paved for people who have education and vocational training that will enable them to gain a foothold and to provide themselves with their own resources. The icing on the cake would be clear rules regarding integration and the practice of religion. Where these are not compatible with our society (women's rights, (religious) special wishes such as gender separation, etc.) a red line would have to go. Anyone who decides to want to come here plays according to our rules and has partially painfully accepted achievements such as the separation of church and state and the unconditional equality of the sexes - without if- and

I have long lost all hope that this government is capable and willing to change this state. If we come to Merkel also under red/red/green the whole thing will be completely degenerate. What could save us would be a massive economic crisis that would bring the real costs of this madness to light. Nobody really wants this - but people learn sustainably only under pain."
"50","POSITIVE","Thank you, Ingrid, for your great statement."
"51","NEUTRAL","The European solution, the distribution between the EU states, does not work. No state can be forced to accept."
"52","NEUTRAL","The asylum policy is stagnating.
New laws, no matter how well they are or could work for themselves, are of no use if the EU community does not finally establish a cooperation in matters of EU external borders!
Everything else is Gemurks around the problem instead of eliminating the problem.
As long as the EU's external borders are slippery, policy does not have to worry about new asylum laws or asylum distribution figures, but rather make a lasting effort to secure the EU's external borders.
This new law idea from Seehofer will not be a good thing, because asylum seekers will still travel on, and most of them are increasingly entitled to asylum.
Dear proliticians, please secure the EU's external borders, and the citizens want to know nothing else."
"53","NEGATIVE","I'll try again, nothing will. If all the political announcements that are important to the citizen were implemented, we would not have some problem here, we have problems and like any party announces something first. New German: Setting a sign. Actual changes? I think you have to look tight."
"54","NEGATIVE","For four years, most people have realised that this has to come.
Only since 01.03.2015, asylum seekers have been practically equal to the unemployed, and then it really started.
Turning this lever back is more than overdue."
"55","NEGATIVE","Oh, great. Illegal entry and massive abuse of asylum does not have criminal consequences to immediate expulsion, but only the unauthorized social assistance is reduced somewhat. Oh, great."
"56","NEUTRAL","“Europe does not meet when dealing with refugees from all over the world. “

Yeah, why is that? Well, there is no European interest of the EU member states to share the pull factor that Chancellor Merkel triggered in September 2015. Why should these states resist the fact that Germany is the country of destination of almost all refugees in the world?

The EU community is going to reject Seehofer's wish, pointing out that you invited them."
"57","NEGATIVE","Europe-wide solution: Then there is no solution guaranteed."
"58","NEGATIVE","Without changing our current right of asylum, all measures are ineffective. And then we also have to abolish dual citizenship in general.
Seehofer's proposal would not be bad if it could be implemented. I think he will not be able to agree with the countries that have an EU external border."
"59","NEGATIVE","Anyone who believes in Mr Seehofer's proposals also believes in Santa Claus. He has proven several times in the past what he has to think of his actionism. This Minister of the Interior is absolutely unbelievable to me.
These proposals are neither enforceable in the European partners, nor in the coalition partner SPD, nor in the opposition of the Greens and the Left."
"60","NEGATIVE","If this works, the AfD shrinks to less than 5 percent. That is, the AfD will probably reject this idea."
"61","NEUTRAL","@rakp: Without the permanent policy without a legal basis, the AfD would not exist.
Maastricht, Dublin, solos, nuclear exit..."
"62","NEGATIVE","Why can I laugh at these intentions?
Anyway, everybody gets relativized and strangled.
I will never understand why the rules of the game have not been set in stone long ago - these are all basics!"
"63","NEUTRAL","I repeat on the 100th time: we need the Danish SPD! And then it goes round - no one WILL come here anymore. And that's how everything dissolves. What comes from Seehofer has never worked. Or he'll make a U-turn again."
"64","NEGATIVE","I can be his, always in the subjunctive! said “suggestions” no longer hear!

Completely unbelievable, because so far he has only swore, but since autumn 2015 nothing relevant or really goal-leading about securing our security & against the DAILY “entry” of mostly illegal migrants to our country!

And instead of reaching a “European solution” again (we have seen for four years where EU compromises in refugee policy are NOT leading!) , NATIONAL measures against the unbearable, illegal immigration of mostly educationally distant people from the religious and cultural circles I have to be taken and implemented by this “Minister of the Interior”!

Strange that a country like the liberal, small Denmark has responded very quickly to illegal immigration with Social Democrat Mette Frederiksen & other far-sighted realpoliticians since 2015:

Their asylum laws have been massively tightened, the “dragged in” cannot long (as in Germany!) in the “social hammock”, they have to learn ragged the Danish language, they become v. the sovereign! Denmark rightly challenged to fulfill its debt of comprehensive integration (language, work et cetera) in an ambitious way!!

It is, in my opinion, hanebüchen (politely said!) , as in any! Regarding “generous” Germany deals with “immigrants” - tightened the asylum laws, partially prevents years of lawsuits before our completely overburdened courts of a good 80 percent “asylum seekers” who have no right to asylum at all!!

My “trust” in this “energetic” government has been exhausted for years - also by constantly swalling in the subjunctive, politically responsible people like Seehofer, whose FIRST priority should be the safety and well-being of their own population!

And Merkel swore that there is no danger from ihome sweepers?! I can't believe it!"
"65","NEUTRAL","Absolutely right, Susanne H. But not integration is a key word here, but return. The Danish Social Democrats are making it clear."
"66","NEGATIVE","How is this supposed to be checked if, for example, there is no central register in D and there is no identification service data? Here, with federalism, we stand on our feet every day."
"67","NEUTRAL","abolish social benefits for refugees and migrants, then no one will come anymore.. instead switch to benefits in kind and sleeping places in dormitories in supervised accommodation with obligation to report... real refugees do not travel before through several safe states and do not benefit from benefits in kind and supervised Accommodation until your status is cleared... or simply implement Dublin 3 as applicable law (no right to asylum in D if you have previously crossed a safe third country)... implement applicable law and do not constantly announce any placebos... Seehofer and this government too are no longer to be taken seriously in this matter"
"68","NEUTRAL","Just apply existing law, Dublin! And a l l e illegally immigrants, refused, etc. can be taken out of the country as soon as it is!"
"69","POSITIVE","I do not believe that Mr Seehofer, or even German politicians, with their older vintages, have any influence on long-established ways of the EU, the UN, the IOM and economic interests. The politicians will soon all go into well-endowed retirement, and my daughter and your generation will bear the consequences. My daughter can leave Germany at any time. As a father, I prepared everything necessary."
"70","NEUTRAL","Well, let's see, Seehofer stop.
When it comes to child benefit, there were also large-announced ideas (problems: payment to children abroad, amount is not based on country of origin, etc.), but then everything was rejected by the EU as illegal."
"71","NEGATIVE","The most obvious and inexpensive prevention reason seems to be no longer interested in these old parties. The care seekers are not interested in protection (they have many times on the way!) but only one - money! Or do I read somewhere that even some of them want to Lithuania? No wonder the wisely pay 10€a month!"
"72","NEUTRAL","My speech. There must be an EU single supply. Asylum seekers will receive the same benefits throughout the EU, measured by the least benefit country. In my opinion, this is Greece at the moment.
A roof over your head (also shared rooms such as in youth hostels or former barracks are enough), 3 meals daily. They earn pocket money, e.g. road cleaning, ditches and banquets in order, free parking lots, parks and forests from waste. There are plenty of ways to earn a pocket money."
"73","NEGATIVE","Unauthorized onward travel should lead to the exclusion of social benefits.
Here Seehofer made the bill without the SPD, the Greens and the Left.
The implementation will simply fail, although the thought would significantly reduce the pull factor."
"74","POSITIVE","Who believes it will be saved. There are too many interests of an entire asylum industry behind it. It has never been easier to earn money than with asylum seekers. Those who have a shabby hotel in the Pampa can have this refurbished and pay 50 euros per nose and day. It's great! The clans have already discovered that. Expensive language and integration courses - lucrative even if almost no one appears after a few weeks."
"75","NEGATIVE","It's best to stop all cash payments, then soon no one would come and a lot of them disappear."
"76","NEUTRAL","Or then the riot really starts here, when those who are already here will claim their achievements to which they have become accustomed... and they know in the pack they are strong.. what do you think is going on in the cities.. offices... roads.. they know exactly why everyone is still paid.. because we who finance all this.. against not on the road and riot.."
"77","NEUTRAL","I hear the message, but I don't have faith.
(from Goethe's Faust)"
"78","NEUTRAL","Mr Seehofer does not seem to have read the Federal Constitutional Court's final verdict on sanctions against uncooperative unemployed?
You can't let anyone live in Germany without financial support.
Accordingly, this sanction on the subject of migrants will disappear in the drawer again.
And if, contrary to expectation, it should become law, be collected by the BVG."
"79","POSITIVE","I think it's good. Finally do, not just announce. If Seehofer does that, he will reap sympathy points!"
"80","NEGATIVE","If you travel without a passport and can always invent new identities, it becomes difficult.
You've lost control and haven't recovered since.
How is this supposed to work?"
"81","NEGATIVE","With this government probably not at all... because with minimal repairs there is nothing to change here. It takes a 180 degree turn, and it doesn't make any of the government parties."
"82","NEGATIVE","The plan is good, but is it implemented? It should be clear to everyone that it cannot continue as before. So, Mr. Seehofen, DO YOU!!! Announcing does not help, I believe it only when it is actually implemented like this. VERIFIABLE!!!"
"83","NEUTRAL","Where does the money for long-distance travel come from? 
Where do long-distance travel travel ID documents come from?
If the refugees have money for long-distance travel, why are social benefits paid in cash?
If the refugees have “lost” their IDs, replacement documents will be issued for travel and, if so, why?
It's the race!"
"84","POSITIVE","These are the right suggestions. But we already know they won't come like this. Thank you SPD!"
"85","NEUTRAL","Na also in the SPD comes the realization that you have to narrow this down. Think there will have to make a compromise alone because of the basic pension."
"86","MIXED","All good ideas, what is missing, who has no papers, can't apply for asylum. Only these demands of the SPD, the Greens and the Left will be massively boycotted. And if they were to do something for us citizens and agree, the EU will not join states because they do not want to accept migrants, because those who do not want to accept people now will not change their mind."
"87","NEGATIVE","“We cannot protect our borders”. This sentence was expressed by Angela Merkel and it is valid to this day. Everything else is just eyewash."
"88","NEUTRAL","Actually, the phrase “I don't want to protect our borders because I don't want to have unsightly pictures” should have been called..."
"89","NEUTRAL","In recent years, DE has bent or circumvented almost all directives and regulations.
the proposals now sound pretty like AFD.
DE has called and the little children come because is soon again Christmas.
maybe, could, would, would, would, would like,...
I would first begin with the distinction of refugee and migrant is but
everything so wanted and keep on so, power up the door makes the gates far...
Merry Christmas to all"
"90","NEUTRAL","Oh, stay calm. Every party chases a new sow through the country every day. One takes care of men's societies, the others do something like climate protection and another do in house occupations and and and so. Everyone knows the list now.
But behind all the strange thoughts there is one basic idea: just do not worry about the real problem and develop thoughtful solutions and, in any case, grab the citizen's pocket. You can probably fill the world with all the announcements of the last two years. In any case, little or nothing comes to us down here except, of course, higher deductions."
"91","NEGATIVE","Who believes it will be soully, who does not believe it still has to pay!!!"
"92","NEGATIVE","Pure eyewash. Seehofer word that nei and never go through, because, firstly, the member states make a line for him, because they do not want and will not accept refugees, and secondly, the BGH always decides in favour of asylum seekers. The latter, of course, is again due to the politicians of S and C parties. So just a calming pill for the German Michel."
"93","NEUTRAL","Seehofer lives out his dreams. Such wishful concerts are actually typical of an opposition party. However, this completely normal and overdue process will not be possible with the CDU. One would then have to take back the right of self-entry that the Chancellor missed all the people in the world without the Bundestag resolution, and also other pull factors (which, according to the German government and the media, do not exist!) crop. Except for the migration pact that the Chancellor celebrated so much."
"94","NEGATIVE","This is more than inconsistent:

“Anyone who travels to another country and lodged another asylum application should be rejected as “obviously unfounded” and should quickly be transferred to the competent state without any action. “

Whoever testifies to such a criminal energy should be returned immediately to the country from where he escaped. Of course, the approved services will also be cancelled!

The same should also apply to those who feel that they have fled to the country from which they have been forced to make a “holiday trip”! 

I am without if- and yet vulnerable, with the emphasis on “needy”, to give a temporary stay here in Germany. But this also means that in return you have to meet the corresponding requirements. Without fixed rules, this will never work to the satisfaction of everyone!"
"95","NEGATIVE","I do not believe that until it will be handled in the same way in two weeks at the latest. Purchase vouchers with proof of identity instead of cash (otherwise they will be exchanged for cash) is an excellent idea, but late. Now finally make nails with heads before the next wave is here."
"96","NEUTRAL","First, the EU rules have to come."
"97","NEGATIVE","Sounds reasonable, is urgent. But reality has exactly two options for this proposal:
1. From the left one shouts: “Nazi methods! “. That's it off the table.
2. One goes to court and the verdict is: violates the principle of equality! That's it off the table."
"98","NEUTRAL","It's all right. But what are the chances of implementation? Remember: Germany is the largest contributor in the EU. Can we really not make any difference in the EU with this fact?"
"99","NEUTRAL","Words are opinions and not deeds, deeds are the only truth!"
"100","NEGATIVE","Then you should save your words, because according to your logic yes untrue."
"101","NEUTRAL","Oh... the Minister of Announcement again. 
Who believes 🤔
If I want to listen to fairy tales I take my Brother Grimm book at hand"
"102","POSITIVE","You don't have to vote on the plan, but simply implement it.
DE already has the laws on it. These, too, are easy to implement and not to be suspended. 

Volunteering? - Of course possible if there is no more supply in DE."
"103","NEUTRAL","Mr Seehofer, there are only laws and their enforcement. 
Of their eternal “should, should, could” at the end of 0,0 we have gradually enough."
"104","NEGATIVE","It doesn't work because there's no one there who can control it. For example, after the change in East Berlin, the Vietnamese all got a residence permit and were only allowed to stay in a certain city. Was violated, there was a YOU, YOU!!! And now Mr. Drehhofer again!!! Here nothing is reformed, here wind is made which cannot be controlled."
"105","NEUTRAL","The plan is right. The reason why we still do not have a European solution in the form of common asylum rules is called Merkel. She doesn't want this solution. A new (CSU?) Chancellor could make the breakthrough. Even if it will certainly not be in vain for our country, the political price for inaction continues to grow."
"106","NEGATIVE","Without the consent of the EU's foreign countries and with controlled external borders and internal border controls, all this will not work. And these foreign countries are not saddened if the arrives continue on their way to other countries (mostly DE). How does the Interior Ministry want to know who is going where when? Again looks like activism without a chance of success."
"107","NEUTRAL","Germany would simply have to apply existing law to bring Dublin, and the illegal people, etc., out of the country."
"108","NEUTRAL","The Ministry of the Interior seems to exist solely through announcements and declarations of intent.
That's how I want to earn my money. If I announce something and didn't do it, someone else will do the job soon.
Why is this not the case in politics? 😞😞😞"
"109","NEGATIVE","I don't think there's gonna be a partner...
In foreign media, Germany is only ridiculed and above all, the migrants, their number and their non-integration capability in our Western life are reported neutral and HORNEST. Mr. Seehofer tries to win back a few votes."
"110","NEGATIVE","Unauthorized onward travel should lead to the exclusion of social benefits.
If you were to believe this statement, it would have to be. 
Unauthorized onward travel automatically leads to the exclusion of social benefits.
Otherwise, this is an announcement by the Minister of the Interior, which he certainly has not yet agreed with his superiors, who certainly do not support him."
"111","MIXED","Sounds good, I alone lack the faith that even a part of it is enforced."
"112","NEGATIVE","I hope that 'unauthorized journey' also applies to politicians who abuse the willingness to fly."
"113","NEUTRAL","Funny... under the applicable law, EU external borders must be protected and no one can enter without corresponding documents, visas, etc....
If you simply implement applicable law, or through it, you can save yourself."
"114","NEGATIVE","True, would be much easier than trying to reinvent the wheel."
"115","NEUTRAL","I really have a practical question now (hoping that it will get through): why do people, when they reach the German border, not just send them back to the country through which they came. Austria, the Czech Republic, France, etc. Then these countries will have to act on their part and will see that they protect their borders. Why do you not build appropriate facilities at the external borders where asylum entitlement is checked and passed accordingly. Why not fight back more effectively against people who are regrettably (even) worse, but who are not entitled to asylum. I really don't understand why this is so difficult."
"116","NEUTRAL","@Eva -Maria K.: I can answer your question with the term 'Schengen Agreement'.

Detailed Definition
Common area under the Schengen Agreement, in which border controls on the movement of persons have been abolished and agreed outside the European Union (EU) through international agreements ('Area without internal border controls'). Not all EU Member States are members of the Schengen area and other countries are members of the Schengen area: 
Non-EU members are Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein (EFTA).
EU members of the Schengen area: Germany, Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Spain, Italy, Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Sweden and Malta.

Thus, if border controls for passenger transport have been abolished throughout Europe and only the Mediterranean is a very permeable external border to the south, countries such as the European Union, for example, can be found to be able to do so. Greece, Italy, France, Spain very badly protect their external borders. It is a dilemma if the refugees have first entered European mainland... they are here."
"117","NEUTRAL","Seehofer's announcements with the word “should” only imply wishful ideas.
What counts in concrete terms are only phrases such as “... will now be implemented in a binding and verifiable manner for everyone”.
See also the statement of Günter Schabowski at the time: “Immediately, immediately”, and behold, the results came immediately, you saw it on almost ALL TV channels."
"118","NEUTRAL","It is very likely that Mr Seehofer wants to demonstrate that a European solution is impossible, in order to finally be able to implement his original plan, to check the right to enter the German border and, if necessary, to make rejections directly at the border."
