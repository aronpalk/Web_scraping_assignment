"1","NEUTRAL","The FDP has clear words. Oh, thank you. Unfortunately, it is hardly represented in the media - e.g. in the WRR. You could become dangerous to the preferred left-green “minions” with simple expertise?"
"2","NEUTRAL","Once again clear words from the FDP. “Staatswirtschaft” meets perfectly, roughly that is what Germany expects with GR2, but possibly also with black-green or green-black (even though the latter has become unlikely by now)."
"3","NEGATIVE","The economy needs rules.
This has nothing to do with state economy.
Without rules that apply to all, it is not progress but selfishness combined with regression in the social and environmental field
You can see where volunteering at the companies leads to nothing.
The economy and its lenders want only one maximum profit."
"4","NEGATIVE","As a reminder:
For ten years, we have built up a capitalism with no interest and money printing a gigantic bubble that has to burst at some point.
Definitely won't work in the long run."
"5","MIXED","The rental cover is supposed to have legal problems at the moment. They're talking about a federal matter. Has one or the other state government leaned a little far out of the window? It remains exciting."
"6","NEUTRAL","The first four articles in world online about the green party convention. That says it all."
"7","NEUTRAL","Can I get a pulse..."
"8","NEUTRAL","Talking when it costs nothing, and silence if it was necessary to open your mouth... this is FDP"
"9","NEUTRAL","The FDP always expresses its views on the important issues of daily policy."
"10","NEGATIVE","The social system that the Greens aspire to is nothing more than the ancient idea of socialism, slightly spiced up with eco-paint. An inflated state apparatus, central planning economy, mind-minded citizens, countless rules and bans, and a dilapidated economy would be the prospect. It didn't work in the GDR. The most recent example of the failure of this approach is Mr Maduro's Venezuela, where hundreds of thousands of desperate people flee the country in flocks. Never worked and will never work."
"11","NEUTRAL","Yes, would be like in China"
"12","NEGATIVE","Yes, Mrs. Teutenberg, let's leave everything to the market. The neoliberal will fix everything. Instead of such statements, a factual dispute would be necessary. Your party, my opinion, can nothing but keywords."
"13","NEGATIVE","Anyone who throws around with “neoliberal” unreflective should not blame others for using keywords.
But first of all, to acquire the basics of the economy."
"14","POSITIVE","It's so beneficial to hear common sense speaking again... thank you for that."
"15","POSITIVE","Yes, dear FDP, we have to! And they are welcome to do so consistently and loudly in the future, one wonders why not so far?"
"16","NEUTRAL","The FDP had a majority in the Bundestag and Bundesrat with the CDU. For electoral reasons, nothing was done and then the majority was gone. Since then standstill. The elite of the CDU and FDP have failed! Chancellor election club and lobbyists! 

It's funny. The former one-dimensional tax reduction party deals with the Greens throughout the day. Must hurt.

In the AKK against Habeck it is clear who will become Chancellor. I am already looking forward to the last desperate attempt by the Conseratives at the next CDU Party Congress.

No one needs the FDP. A liberal party does. It is the responsibility of the FDP that many did not care about the idea of freedom."
"17","NEUTRAL","“With AKK versus Habeck it is clear who will become Chancellor."" - Yes, Spahn. After AKK resigns and spahn then makes promises the AFD voters are likely to please. It is then easy to choose from parliament as chancellor without consultation or cooperation. With voices from FDP and AfD. Their voices then pass through appropriate laws, and the others are free to participate in other topics or they leave it."
"18","NEUTRAL","@Teuteberg demanded: “We must finally talk again about how we not only distribute wealth, but also generate it beforehand. “

Above slogan should memorize every green sympathizer."
"19","POSITIVE","I would vote for Mrs Teuteberg immediately."
"20","NEUTRAL","Because she would distribute the money generated to the right ones for her?"
"21","POSITIVE","“We must finally talk again about how we not only distribute wealth, but also generate it beforehand.” The basic problem of many red-green ideas, in a nutshell. Of course, you make friends with more retirement and a rental price brake. And the fight against the evil automotive industry is not only fond of FfF. So environmentally friendly. Free daycare is also pretty. Low prices for bus tickets also.
However, it is not enough to briefly express this criticism on the occasion of Bundeparteitagen dpa. There is a lack of a liberal-conservative cross-party initiative that makes itself felt in the public and gives a voice to those citizens who know that expenditure must be compensated by revenue, including expenditure on migration."
"22","NEGATIVE","For me, the Greens are the ones who say, “the electricity is coming out of the socket anyway”. Anyone who only cares about “green” but does not have to offer a coherent and economically prosperous concept for all other aspects of politics is no better for me as a party than a “car driver party” or “I just want a nice party”. Anyone who wants to find out about this and is looking for it on the Homegage of the Greens will not find a party program there for a long time, but it will be referred to its creation. Where's an old old one? Was there never one, or would you rather not show it? Where's the new one?"
"23","NEGATIVE","Where is the FDP? Always against it, no own profile and program. Sad"
"24","NEUTRAL","Oh in the Bundestag much comes from them, is often taken over by the CDU later than their own good idea, but before this was rejected, mostly by all parties. What's that?"
"25","NEUTRAL","Scarce, precise, put things in a nutshell. The CDU workers from Ziemiak to Kramp Karrenbauer should take tutoring lessons at Teuteberg.
In the rest, she is right."
"26","NEUTRAL","The new left - more sympathetic, bourgeois, younger than the SPD and without the burden of the SED"
"27","NEUTRAL","The green ones. Don't they also ask for daycare for free? In the conurbations - where they often co-rule - there were no daycare places, although since the 1980s the founding had repeatedly demanded this in elections and in the opposition. Now the federal government has recognized every child a statutory right to a daycare place. The result: People pay up to €700 or more? in Munich (red-green) for this place. If it is to be free now, it is, firstly, unfair to those who have had to pay the last decades, and secondly, these costs must be imposed on anyone. Fiscal social war? Example public transport: A mass transport that is not self-financed. Up to 80% subsidized. Logic of green: 1.) Further expansion with billions from the Treasury. 2.) A German citizen can afford a car and finance it himself (500 - 1,000 €p.m.?). However, the user of public transport cannot afford 50€- 250€. Is this normal now or already beginning mental illness? And instead of using the billions of motorists for the environment, social benefits are to be distributed to people who do not need it. Flanked by unrestrained accusations against motorists. I see what you have to do, but with antisocial means and lies to separate society again between good and evil is probably the last thing! It's a good thing when a young woman is responsible for doing something about it."
"28","NEGATIVE","If we do not curb the neoliberalism of recent years and we develop common social goals, the 'prosperity' will not help us to achieve it by far not all our fellow citizens. What is “prosperity”? Every 2nd year a new smartphone? If possible, “fat cars” to show his personal performance to the outside? Many flight hours a year? We cannot continue to produce “expensive scrap” just to preserve jobs. The lack of imagination on the conservative-right side of society about how to sustainably produce, live and make profits is already frightening. Just keep it up, it's no longer a good thing."
"29","NEGATIVE","We live in a state system where the state manages about 3/4 of GDP. And you're talking about neoliberalism? She can't be serious. All this junk exists only because the citizens can't afford normal goods. The state is taking everything away from you. That's why the junk comes from China and the washing machine for the yellow bag can only cost 200, -. Liberalism can be viewed roughly if the state manages 1/4 of GDP. At 1/2, one can still speak of a strongly socially marked market economy, with good will. And at 3/4, quite a few economists already speak of real socialism."
"30","NEUTRAL","Dream castles already exist in crowds. With residence permit. In many large German cities, around half of the inhabitants already have the WBS. Where else is this going to lead? 

ANGAR & BANGE is preparing for you."
"31","POSITIVE","True words!
Quote: ""Teuteberg demanded: “We must finally talk again about how we not only distribute wealth, but also generate it beforehand. “End of Quotation"
"32","NEUTRAL","None is taken away anything. She confirms the opposite. But nothing will change again."
"33","MIXED","It's easy for the Greens to promise or promote everything right now, only if you really need to govern who should say who should pay for all this. Taxes can hardly be increased! Isn't it?"
"34","NEUTRAL","Observe changes for precious metals from 2020. Still air upstairs."
"35","NEUTRAL","How is a party of dropout and prosperity provided to understand anything about added value? Values are just there for these people and just need to be distributed. Of course, you like to saw yourself, but discreetly, a thick piece from the cake."
"36","NEGATIVE","The last government in Germany that really did something was red-green. You won't experience your blue miracle..."
"37","NEUTRAL","Well, Mrs Teuteberg, you're not wrong. Only: what concepts do you or the FDP have? Criticism gains substance when you can present your own ideas/ideas. And that's what the FDP has lacked for a long time!"
"38","NEGATIVE","That's why they always jap at the 5% hurdle. On the last election, it was just before suffocation death... just like that. Pusher?"
"39","POSITIVE","Worth reading about the fact check “Prevent the Ecodiktatur” by Richard D. Precht im “Stern” from 24.10.19. He looks further than until the next legislature, does not float in the eco-heaven, as some forists describe politics, but brings facts from independent scientists. Even with the amazing radio survey in hr3, the Hessian listeners realized that e.g. winning Christmas Shopping flights to NY is no longer opportive! I'm getting bad after reports about e.g. endless consumption shows in China. Too many people, unthought-out consumption, the impacts come faster and more violent - fires in Australia, Florida, Venice flood, tornado in Hesse with thousands of drought weakened, uprooted trees, the list is already considerable this year..."
"40","NEGATIVE","Well, Claudia.
So the women's dream and Greta did it: I want you to get scared!"
"41","NEUTRAL","Quote from Henry Ford: It's not the entrepreneur who pays the wages - he just hands over the money."
"42","NEGATIVE","Right is se.
Just a little delayed."
"43","POSITIVE","I always like the Linda better! Right, prosperity must first be elaborated, but the green prohibition party has never understood that."
"44","NEUTRAL","germany is fine.
As a result, around 6.92 million consumers are currently unable to pay their bills. That is just under 10 000 less than in the previous year. Nevertheless, for every tenth adult, overall expenditure remained consistently higher than revenue."
"45","NEUTRAL","What are not included, are the starvation to make no debts or the ones who don't make debts anymore because no one lets it."
"46","NEUTRAL","We have reached a point where we should go new ways. We know the teachings of Conservative Liberals who prefer a primate ecology and its standstill.

The Greens, which I find refreshing, lack economic vision and competence.

My tip on this, you should hire economists who describe as C. Felber, the way to an economy where money and markets serve people again, instead of a primate economy.

Otherwise, the greens will be flatten by the primates."
"47","POSITIVE","I also find the AFD refreshing Dietmar A."
"48","NEGATIVE","The prosperity needs to be earned is obviously unknown to the actors in the red-green environment. They just live beyond reality."
"49","NEUTRAL","It's prosperity, you think..."
"50","NEUTRAL","Only one thing comes from the FDP: economy! An economic area is needed in order to be able to operate economies. If we gradually destroy our environment and do not slow down the economic degradation of the environment in the short term, economies will eventually become impossible. If we want to survive, we must remove the idea of an ever-growing economy from our memory. Over the next few years, we will have to reassure ourselves that strong growth has come to an end, otherwise we will accept that our environment will perish."
"51","NEGATIVE","We are no longer able to cope with the dream castle consequences of this government, and they are already reality. Fortunately, that of the left is not yet."
"52","NEUTRAL","What is the difference between the Greens and a phone booth?
At the phone booth it is necessary to pay only then dial."
"53","POSITIVE","It's good!"
"54","NEUTRAL","A mini-contribution about the legitimate criticism of the FDP general secretary Linda Teutenberg is framed by 3 major contributions about the charitable charitable of Habeck. Looks like this neutral journalism?"
"55","NEUTRAL","Is there anything else in our house that is neutral?"
"56","NEGATIVE","What is added to the coffee in the FDP? The dream castles have been built in Germany for 14 years or some parties even live in it! Here, the FDP only tries to jump up on the line of opinion, which finally removes A. M. from the way. People from the FDP finally come up with something else. It's bored!"
"57","NEUTRAL","Remy X
The Lindner wanted a committee of inquiry against Merkel after 2015.
After the AfD submitted the application for this, the FDP does NOT vote in favour and thus prevented it because the 25% of the BT members were not reached.
So much for the FDP
If the motion had been passed, a lot of things might have developed differently here in the country."
"58","POSITIVE","Mrs Teuteberg is right!"
"59","NEUTRAL","When I see the green-red hype in the “old” federal states, I sometimes get overwhelmed by the clumsical feeling that far too little is reported and taught about experiment socialism of 49-89 in the eastern zone. Unfortunately, most often people come to such “funny” ideas when they are too well. In the next few years, we will all be back to the ground of the facts. The green dream dances will disappear and the mature citizen will find that a country cannot be governed with climate protection, destruction of auto and energy-producing industries, equality, prohibitions and regulations.
Mrs Teuteberg is right and we are on the way to recession. The government must finally innovate, develop progeamme in order to strengthen the economy and bring it forward again, because this is the only way to preserve the current prosperity and the conscientiously plagued green urban man can continue cycling to work."
"60","NEGATIVE","The FDP did not work in the black yellow government and, after great efforts by Mr Lindner, left the exploratory talks to a Jamaica coalition. Now the FDP has no design potential and no power option. That won't change so quickly."
"61","NEUTRAL","Even though many see it differently today, even in the FDP: I think it is right that the FDP did not want to coalise with everyone. it can't everyone with everyone, unless he gives up his beliefs or has none."
"62","NEUTRAL","The FDP is free from Merkel dilettantism and hopefully stays on track. Only, they have too few voters!"
"63","NEUTRAL","“The Greens, according to Teuteberg, did not go towards the social market economy at their Bundesparteitag in Bielefeld with topics such as the departure from the debt brake, a right to housing through a rental cover and the increase in the minimum wage. “They go at a distance from Agenda 2010 and towards expensive state economy. “
1. The logic says that as GDP increases, money in circulation increases, or vice versa.
 Since money supply = amount of debt (money is generated via debt), at desired
rising GDP also increases the debt volume. The state, companies, private individuals and foreign countries are eligible for debtors. If the latter 3 restrain themselves, the state is in demand with new debts.Otherwise, there is no rising GDP.

2. Higher minimum wage increases demand as long as producers have problems with sales, and it then increases GDP through new investment.

3. Rental cover dampens the bubble of the decoupled market economy (limited amount of housing is a dysfunctional market economy)"
"64","MIXED","Great voice of the FDP aunt... did the AFD not have anything to say about the subject?"
"65","NEGATIVE","However, the AfD has been criticizing this “policy” for many years, but is largely ignored by the media. Fortunately, not from the voter. He seems smarter."
"66","NEGATIVE","As everyone may have noticed, Green critical reports are formulated with the utmost care and deliberately kept very short. For other parties, such an article would be 10 times as long."
"67","NEUTRAL","Digitisation will make the majority of commercial officers, administrative officials, industrial workers, but also parts of the service sector unemployed. In addition, the fertility years will soon retire. The old mechanisms of economic theory and policy will no longer be effective in the foreseeable future. Our society needs to be rebuilt so that present and future generations can enjoy a redefining prosperity. The fact that an FDP as an alleged economic party does not understand this is really weak. The Greens are not the salvation bearer, but at least try to name the injustices within society and start a social discussion. Unfortunately, no one is so entitled to the discussion, but it is only countered with economic theories that are no longer current. The future must be shaped, not the past restored, or the present must be preserved. This is the only chance given the immense challenges that are waiting for us soon."
"68","NEGATIVE","The Greens want to introduce climate socialism. That will not be the right answer to the pressing questions."
"69","POSITIVE","It's not just the dream castles of the LEFT! Germany cannot afford that of our government either!"
"70","NEUTRAL","ahhhh... our government is on the left."
"71","POSITIVE","I think there are politicians with a clear mind, all respect."
"72","NEGATIVE","Bite late, huh?"
"73","NEUTRAL","“At their federal parteitag, the Greens discussed the rental cover, the minimum wage and a departure from the debt brake. “

These themes are red and not “green”.
The sill SPD resembles the sick grandmother, whose savings books are attacked prematurely.

The tranquilizer color green, which is also used in clinics and operating areas,
is ideally suited to operate open heart voters.

In other words:
Red ideas in front of green sunflower walls are dishonesty and label fraud.

The children's book author Habeck is on Merkel's course: party meltdown and power gain. Quickly after the cramped brisk three-day bart add a few pseudo-economic knockout drops, and the fretsaw work is done.

The first German children's book chancellor gets ready."
"74","NEUTRAL","When I hear the FDP, I somehow automatically think of the call for tax cuts for hoteliers and ask myself whether five percent of voters can afford to vote to the FDP if this party would rather not rule rather than possibly rule wrong."
"75","NEUTRAL","Hmm Strangely the CDU does not want to talk to the AFD and the Left in Thuringia either.
But since left +AfD have > 50% of the seats this will be difficult. How do you want to achieve something if you always have at least 50% against vote.
Or is 40% the new majority?"
"76","NEUTRAL","Is this article a contribution on the evaluation of green concepts BY the Secretary General of the FDP Ms Teuteberg 

or GREEN ADVERTISING? The second seems to me to be the case.

So when I open the article, I see Mr Habeck everywhere in the picture and links to the GREEN and not to the views of the FDP with Mrs Teuteberg?

Do you want to offer a forum to the FDP in the media - only to the GREEN?"
"77","NEGATIVE","This is nothing new here."
"78","NEUTRAL","Son to father in 2033: “Daddy, why do we live in a cave? “Oh, you know, in 2019 we thought we should choose green! “"
"79","NEUTRAL","The FDP also rejects all of the AfD's proposals in the Bundestag. Credibility looks different!"
"80","NEUTRAL","That's right. As long as that is the case, the FDP wants nothing but to swim in the mainstream and just not to bother. We don't need to."
"81","NEGATIVE","Left economic models only lead to shortages and deterioration.

Therefore, we now try to morally exaggerate renunciation, lack and renunciation with green ideology!"
"82","NEUTRAL","And work runs again “for the good of the Lord!” We're just not nuns! But the idea is the same. Social outlaws and inquisition, if you do not conform to morality."
"83","NEGATIVE","That's the intelligence problem of all the left. The simplest logic that everything you intend to divide must be generated by anyone before, you simply do not understand. That seems too high for her."
"84","NEGATIVE","Mr. Thatcher put it very aptly: “The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money.” 
I find it very depressing how many people there are who still have not understood this after about 80 failed socialism experiments. And the fact that these are among the political “elite” and the future “bearers of hope” in Germany is deeply disturbing."
"85","NEGATIVE","“Neo-Lieberale dream castles Germany can't afford” Absolutely true!
I am absolutely for people who are in a plight that will help them. But the green, social megalomania must be financed! He's getting more and more out of hand and in the long run it can't go on like this! Who's financing it? Those who work every day go and pay taxes and not politics!"
"86","NEGATIVE","I share the criticism of the Green Air Castles.
In the FDP, however, I lack a clear edge and really promising topics.
These include unpleasant issues such as the EU, the euro, migration, border protection, pensions, pensions, crime. 
These are the positions that decide whether we are at the height of the Balkans in 30 years or whether we are still in the lead."
"87","NEGATIVE","just read the party program and do not rely on the media to inform about it."
"88","NEUTRAL","The Greens won their campaign only when the German economy is completely down and Germany has completely lost its connection."
"89","NEGATIVE","But, of course, all of this is still to blame for evil capitalism."
"90","NEUTRAL","The cardinal question for me - am in favour of good environmental protection - is how much socialism is in the Greens?

Because one thing is clear, there is no socialism with freedom of expression!

If you look at two core themes of the Greens:

- climate and environmental protection, then freedom of expression is called into question.

“Climate protection is greater than democracy,” many Greens say

- Refugee and migration policy, then freedom of expression is called into question

“Open borders and participation for all are above national interests,” many Greens say

You can see that the more the state determines and intervenes, the more it also has to control freedom of expression and banish unwelcome opinions, otherwise of course this will not work."
"91","NEUTRAL","“how much socialism is in the Greens?” -DSRuns are 90% Trittin!"
"92","NEGATIVE","“Neo-Liberal Dreamcastles can't afford Germany “. That's right. It is clear from the expected pensions for today's youth. Low-cost workers have never been helpful in the long run."
"93","NEUTRAL","Only what has been generated can be distributed. The Greens should know that too. What we need now is a party that does not let Germany get drunk as a business location, but promotes entrepreneurial creativity and does not harassment with renewed editions and burdens. It is not without reason that Germany is almost at the very top of the rank of new start-ups worldwide.

Not only the Greens do I lack the perception of small and medium-sized enterprises. After all, it is the engine of our economy, which also finances politicians! 

The ecological conversion is important, but it is not always an absolute priority! What is the use of the reconstruction if the already devastated economy suffers even more? Habeck rightly admonished to listen again. Some things seem to fail not only because of “listening”, but also because of this partly environment-moralin-better-mentality-arrogance."
"94","NEGATIVE","Right to housing means planned economy. Inevitably. The state must manage the existing housing. No one will be so stupid to invest in apartments or build new ones. The apartment will then be allocated by the state, which is difficult to choose yourself. Potential green voters should think very well about whether they really want state-controlled forced economy and a life in the communalka. The everyday life could then become a bit disappointing..."
"95","NEUTRAL","“Towards expensive state economy” is consistent. Finally, the red-green-dominated politics of recent years strangles the private economy and has now switched Germany into sales mode. A large part of the Green Clients Party and its voters live quite well on tax-financed jobs - these need to be preserved and expanded as long as this is still possible and alternative policies can be prevented."
"96","NEUTRAL","Where's the money coming from?"
"97","NEGATIVE","The neoliberal concept has failed, market opening and globalization has allowed too many people to get under their wheels. The Neo Cons are (with an ineffective left) the real fault of AFD & Co., as their promises only used the upper classes. However, their dogmas of turbocapitalism forbid it to think socially democratically, i.e. to pursue the policy that has brought Germany to prosperity and has kept the poor and rich scissors small."
"98","NEUTRAL","????"
"99","MIXED","The prosperity in Germany is like a rubber band that can be pulled longer and longer. (But with a check potential)
At some point, the elongation is exhausted and it tears or goes back to zero again.
That's where we steer with all the bubbles."
"100","MIXED","There will not be a green government without insurrection, and it is already overdue anyway. The yellow vests say hello!"
"101","NEUTRAL","Unfortunately, not with the Germans. According to Lenin, if you stormed a station during a revolution, the Germans would first buy platform tickets."
"102","POSITIVE","But you have already come a long way in the now almost 40 years.
Starting as a protest party, they are already wondering where the money should come from.
The learning speed is remarkable."
"103","NEUTRAL","Is the FDP really the last party to have a realistic view of the world?"
"104","NEUTRAL","Yes, so become a member."
"105","NEGATIVE","Always that idiot debt brake! If private and corporate sectors save, then the state has to blame meaningfully - the emphasis is on sensible -. Money has never been so cheap, and the state has to invest massively in infrastructure and education in a recession. Making debts like stupid would be announced but instead the Holy Black Zero is propagated. 

I can no longer hear the complaint of our politicians that future generations would have to pay back the debts. It is much more serious that our entire infrastructure is now being worn out and that we are transporting the most important prerequisites for prosperity (mobility of citizens and electricity) into the locomotive through nonsensical energy policy decisions. 

Debt making is right now, we can actually write off the foreign credits (Target 2 balances), i.e. debt of the foreign to Germany."
"106","NEUTRAL","John Maynard Keynes would spin in the grave. Deficit spending in crises but reduce debt in good times. Why do the Social Democrats and the Greens remember their theories only when it comes to making debts? Keynes was still seriously thinking about the goal. That is to boost the economy."
"107","NEUTRAL","I know the last party programs of the FDP.
Perhaps many people are not aware that the FDP stands for privatisation, reduction and privatisation of social benefits, as well as massive relief for the wealthy and large corporations.
This has always been the case and is completely normal in liberalism.
The original liberalism, even in its pure form, goes so far that it considers the state to be completely superfluous and wants to replace all areas of life with privatisation.
How can you support such a system?
Above all - WHO supports such a system?
Of course, only those who have the financial capabilities to afford the best private medical performance and the best private hedging.
Economic liberalism (hence the FDP) basically rejects the principle of solidarity, because a system of solidarity entails a weakening of powerful financially viable companies and that of the citizens who are financially well located.
I therefore believe that the FDP can undoubtedly affirm a worrying view of human beings. An image of human beings that divides people into value categories and performance categories."
"108","NEUTRAL","Yes, distributing is easier than generated. Unfortunately, the politicians of different parties do not know that. The many sociologists and political scientists in the parliaments do not have much professional experience in the social product-creating industries. Who is surprised by the partly existing strangers of the world."
"109","NEUTRAL","Left-wing fundamentally do not know that."
"110","NEUTRAL","Most of the new Green voters were yesterday's younger SPDlers. A few bourgeois with a left-liberal touch join them. In this respect, the wrong parties are compared. The FDP addresses around 10% of the population, and it will remain in principle ethical values. Although we Germans prefer decentralization in political units, we love the state that acts as dad or mom, but at least patronizing and controlling. The individual and self-organization are distrusted. We also love dogmatism. There is a reason that Protestantism was invented on the one hand, at the same time witch persecutions were radically carried out. Or the nationalism of the 18th/19th century coupled with the idea of social equality, communism and even national socialism were exaggerated. And so it will be with ecologism."
"111","NEGATIVE","It's a mystery for me why the FDP simply fails to position itself sharply and design an overall concept. Little small to details more does not come. Where is the grand draft of liberalism in the 21st century? Apparatschik syndrome here too, unfortunately."
"112","POSITIVE","For me, it is also a mystery why the FDP cannot position itself more strongly as a progressive liberal party between right and left. It must clearly articulate its political objectives and present itself as an authentic party of the democratic centre - between right-wing radicalism and socio-ecological overriding! It may have to argue less rationally and critically and to incite people's aspirations more (prosperity, security, peace, living future, respectful interaction, open society, liberal values, tolerance, moderate language...). People are more reached by feelings than by critical-rational and good arguments, which are of course also very important; however, one must be able to communicate them correctly, with the right emotional pitch."
"113","NEUTRAL","A right to dwell would involve a right to expropriation. So watch out."
"114","NEUTRAL","And there is no wonder why not create enough private living space."
"115","NEUTRAL","... there is a lot of talk about increasing productivity.
Regardless of which party, for the German Michel, it is ultimately said: Steigerun, i.e. increase = extra costs for everything.
This is then the increase in the productivity of the parties, good night Germany,..."
"116","NEUTRAL","The article deals with Mrs Teuteberg's point of view. And why do we see only pictures of Habeck and not of Mrs. Teuteberg for this article?"
"117","POSITIVE","Eckin: I would also find it more visually pleasant."
"118","NEGATIVE","How about once the government is blamed for the problems and not the opposition."
"119","NEGATIVE","Why should Germany not be able to afford something that already exists in mass."
"120","NEUTRAL","“We must finally talk again about how we not only distribute wealth, but also generate it beforehand.” Yes, we must. And also about how we avoid destroying it further (e.g. shutdown of base load power plants without real-life replacement)."
"121","NEUTRAL","Can we store old uranium fuel rods in your bathtub?"
"122","POSITIVE","Looking from AT, I find this all in D very entertaining and amusing"
"123","POSITIVE","Och from Thailand I find both Germany and Austria funny. As I was back in Germany the last few months I have to say I found Austria funnier!"
"124","NEUTRAL","As long as the FDP is always very happy with voting what the government parties decide, out of fear that the AfD would otherwise benefit, I cannot take the FDP seriously and even more so cannot vote."
"125","NEUTRAL","Unfortunately it is, for example, she has borne the property tax."
"126","NEUTRAL","The Greens are primarily committed to tenants (rental cover), workers (minimum wage) and responsibility for the future (more investment). With the FDP, it's just the other way around."
"127","NEUTRAL","What good is the tenants of the tenants if the landlords subsequently lack the money for toilet covers?"
"128","MIXED","... just now the energy companies have announced the increase in the electricity price of about 5% for 2020. These will be followed by gas and petrol prices. Then we go to the fares, and and and. Everything in the program and to the full satisfaction of the Greens.
The German Michel will not come out of the wonder what these Green Dreams will cost him."
"129","NEGATIVE","Air travel are in fact much too cheap. This is where the state definitely has to start."
"130","NEUTRAL","How many percent does the FDP stand the same? There's a reason for that."
"131","NEUTRAL","Yes, in addition to self-made mistakes, the reason was the media destruction of the FDP by the public broadcasters, through broadcasts such as the weekly show. In addition to the Bavarian bashing, FDP -bashing is the favorite content of various so-called caberettists."
"132","NEUTRAL","The generating of prosperity interests the average green voter only very indirectly, since he is mainly employed in the public service (source: https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article166815938/Zwei-Befunde-zu-den-Gruenen-Waehlern-ueberraschen.html). Therefore, no dream castle is too big to vote for it. Anyone who no longer feels the pressures of existence in the form of imminent unemployment can literally be enthused for any mischief. However, this is not a whole new realization..."
"133","NEUTRAL","Unfortunately true... and if everything is broken socialized, then comes the famous saying: “We did not want that”, or that was not true socialism!!"
"134","NEUTRAL","2 words to describe the left-oriented greens range: 
“Prosperity neomarxists”
From an article in the NZZ..."
"135","POSITIVE","Very nicely put to the point!"
"136","NEUTRAL","In the meantime, I am no longer sure whether this opinion, which is believed to be correct by many, can still be so openly expressed. In a very simple way, the one who asks for some Green proposals about the financiability or even the benefits for the general public is already a member of the wrong party. Certainly, some points, which have to be accepted, are certainly not entirely wrong. The whole party, with its diverse, sometimes also communist features, is probably more of a problem for the future of our country and especially for our children. The future with a backward-looking party with only one subject, without any comprehensible solutions, is a catastrophe for an industrialized country. Problem for us voters is because the ordinary citizen does not necessarily like to vote on the right, the SPD has completely failed, the CDU dismantled itself and the Greens is probably also unselectable for the broad mass that looks beyond the box. And now what?"
"137","NEUTRAL","I think at least temporarily vote right protest until it settles. That's how it's best to sell it to the followers."
"138","NEUTRAL","GG “... change federal laws... be amended by the votes of two-thirds of the members of the German Bundestag and two-thirds of the votes of the Federal Council... “Wikipedia


If Habeck promises from the Greens to amend the Basic Law... he would need two thirds of majority in the Bundesrat AND Bundestag, he doesn't have that.

This double majority has no party. 

Even the Groko in her best days did not have her.

With that you can impress “Friday for future “children but no adult voters, Mr. Habeck."
"139","POSITIVE","Hopefully (and keep) you right!!"
"140","NEUTRAL","make the political opponent “bad” is not enough to seem credible. So it will not be anything with the FDP."
"141","NEUTRAL","Who's gonna do it with? Please name a single party that doesn't make the political opponent AfD bad!"
"142","NEGATIVE","Distributing prosperity without thinking goes in the wrong direction. In principle, it is important to consider who has developed this prosperity and who, by virtue of this subsequent realization, is entitled to the distribution of this prosperity, a distribution of the prosperity of workers to groups that have not contributed to the creation of this prosperity without a critical analysis. I'm inappropriate."
"143","POSITIVE","In green packaging, the old left store keepers are again served today!"
"144","NEUTRAL","It's strange: if you read the opinions on statements of the FDP superiors here in the forum, you mostly read approval. Then why hardly anyone chooses them? There is a reason for the olle camels with the hotels, or that you prefer to choose “the original”. People, the AfD is just as far away from a liberal attitude as the Greens or Donald Trump. The AfD would like to draw a big wall around Germany and reintroduce the Deutschmark so that we are “among ourselves”. They can't think of many other areas, as they themselves say. Anyone who listens to Mr Lindner or Mrs Teuteberg discovers that there is much more behind it. And reproach them for having pushed themselves against government responsibility is also missed. Jamaica under Merkel would have become pure black green, she would have fulfilled every wish for the eco-fantasies, just as she is now doing at the SPD. A FDP who wants to stand up for their beliefs can only lose. The last sentence in the above article summarizes it: You can only distribute if you have previously generated what to distribute. Socialism has always been ill with this, and the vision of the Greens is sick. And the AfD's “vision” of simply leaving all the costsmen (immigrants, the EU) outside does not work in times of globalisation either. 

Liberal vote does not hurt, just try it out. In times of populist left and right, we need the strong middle. That's because it's generating our prosperity."
"145","NEUTRAL","Of course, “THE” works... see Hungary, Poland,, Denmark (and all this without walls). So please write a little more differentiated. Thanks"
"146","NEUTRAL","If the FDP finds any social balance too expensive, but at the same time remains soft to the very expensive illegal migration - according to a few strong words - then it will not offer homeless voters. Then only remains: protest voice until the CDU, FDP, also SPD wake up (the Greens continue to dream - beautiful as Habeck, but in a dream nobody encounters realities)."
"147","NEUTRAL","Prosperity in Germany is generated enough. But if 1% of the population control 25% of the assets, managers earn 300 times more than their employees, and financial speculation remains tax-free, while every craftsman pays VAT, the mass of the population doesn't really get much of it."
"148","POSITIVE","But the manager builds himself a beautiful house, boat, car, etc. And thus creates more jobs."
"149","POSITIVE","It is veiling to me why so many people (especially in the West) want socialism. Just make a time travel: Socialism = State of the Eastern Bloc States 1945 - 1990.
The sharper form is communism: Cambodia, China, Russia (Stalin).
I can't believe you think that this is desirable.
Be glad you're allowed to live here!"
"150","NEGATIVE","Yeah, that's too veiling to me. And I live in the West."
"151","POSITIVE","After 3, multi-page and nicely illustrated articles about Robert Habeck, a five-line about the FDP was necessary because of impartiality. So it seems"
"152","NEUTRAL","But even an article about the FDP is illustrated with photos of Habeck."
"153","NEGATIVE","This lady should think about what mischief the FDP has to blame for at least the last 15 years.

Where they ruled, it wasn't really better either."
"154","NEGATIVE","Well in North Rhine-Westphalia, after the red green years of neglect, it is slowly going up again."
"155","NEUTRAL","The move away from the debt brake is (especially) economically sensible on the verge of a recession - even if the proposal comes from the Greens. But a party like the FDP, which is constantly peddling with its supposedly high economic competence, should not iron such a proposal so flat."
"156","NEUTRAL","Theoretically you may have recjt - Sber not here and now, since we have long lived above our standards (welfare state vs. infrastructure, Target2). What Habeck wants then goes back to the false ideological air castles where after 20 years one finds that it doesn't work."
"157","NEUTRAL","The failure of the GDR and the Soviet Union does not mean that Marxism and its representatives have abandoned the struggle against bourgeois society and capitalism"
"158","NEGATIVE","Unfortunately, they didn't learn anything"
"159","NEUTRAL","Direction of expensive state economy = socialism, we are already on a good path, through the SPD, and a CDU/CSU that nods everything!"
"160","NEUTRAL","Unfortunately, the FDP has not taken advantage of its opportunities in recent years (from 2015), perhaps it is now taking a new attempt and finally becomes selectable for all people to whom the AFD is too crackly in the argument. If the FDP were to stand up slightly to the right of the middle with its liberal character, it could become the new CDU and offer a new political home to many people in our country."
"161","NEUTRAL","Nevertheless, the FDP has been too radical in its demands in recent years.
The common good and ethics must also be taken into account when it comes to business."
"162","NEUTRAL","She's right. Our concern must be to increase productivity. This is not only suffering from the overflowing social expenditure, but also from the rising electricity."
"163","NEUTRAL","Where do the social spending go?"
