"1","NEGATIVE","The AFD is not consistent, I just write “” Landolf Ladig “”!
It would continue with calbitz, and who just recently bought a house with the identities?!
The list is infinite."
"2","NEGATIVE","Mr. Scheil uses mainly primary sources for his būchers or publications by international military historians, such as J.F.C. Fuller or Sir Basil Liddel Hart.I cannot understand what is to be reprehensible."
"3","NEUTRAL","“I can't understand what should be reprehensible”

Lutz E., One possible answer can be found here:

Quote:
“It will be about “lies”, at the beginning of November at the Ingolstadt Volkshochschule, about “The Lebenslügen der Bundesrepublik Deutschland”. This is the name of the lecture that the historian and Rhineland-Palatinate AFD politician Stefan Scheil wants to give there. In science, he is considered to many colleagues as a “revisionist”, who tries to relativize Germany's guilt during the Second World War. The former head of the Center for Anti-Semitism Research in Berlin, Wolfgang Benz, accused Scheil of “using history only as a raw material for ideological constructs”. For example, he constructs an aggressive war policy in Poland or interprets the raid on the Soviet Union as a preventive war.”

"4","NEUTRAL","I am concerned with the question - why did 25% vote for the Hocke in Thuringia and only 21% vote for the Mohring? Yeah, why?"
"5","NEUTRAL","Monika R., A possible answer to your very good question may be found in the darkest chapter of Thuringia's history.

Quote:
“It was the beginning of the rise of the Nazi Party and Adolf Hitler. In Weimar's nationally minded bourgeoisie, the propaganda of the National Socialists fell on fertile ground. In Thuringia, they also celebrated their first parliamentary victory: after the Landtag elections of December 8, 1929, the NSDAP was involved for the first time in a country's government. Wilhelm Frick became the first National Socialist Minister of Germany. On January 23, 1930, he was elected Minister of the Interior and National Education by the Landtag. And he left no doubt as to where the journey was going. During his term of office, he anticipated the dictatorship established throughout Germany from 1933: he cleaned up the civil servants and occupied important posts with Nazi trustees. Erich Maria Remarque's success book “Nothing new in the West” was banned for all schools and libraries in the country, school prayers were introduced against the “contamination of German people by foreign racial unculture”.”

“Under the National Socialist Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick, pictures from the Weimar museum collection were sorted out as “degenerate art” in 1931. At the same time, the National Socialists pushed forward the exchange of personnel in the police and the state administration.”

“Especially the petty-bourgeois milieu felt fear at the height of the Great Depression to lose everything again after World War I and inflation. On 26 August 1932, Fritz Sauckel, the Weimar Gauleiter of the party, was elected Prime Minister.”

"6","NEUTRAL","It is more than regrettable that the AfD obviously continues to drift to the right and thus there is no more conservative alternative to the CDU & CSU, which the citizen can still vote in good conscience."
"7","MIXED","The media are not innocent of that. If, for years, all members are equated with Nazis, then those who do not want to endure this equality - that is, the Democrats. Those who don't care about the Nazi comparison are left behind.

Thus, thanks to the media, AfD is slowly becoming more and more of what the media has called it for years. Quasi a self-fulfilling prophecy."
"8","POSITIVE","Mr Höcke also has his place in a vibrant, growing democracy."
"9","NEUTRAL","favete linguis, In a court ruling, it was stated that one can rightly call a certain AFD-Hocke as a fascist, on the grounds that his writings clearly show that he has a fascist attitude. Thus, this certain AFD hock has a lot to do with fascism and not the slightest of a “living, growing democracy”, as you wrongly claim!

Quote:
“In addition, it has been 'sufficiently credited' that the designation was 'not taken from the aerial, 'but is based on a verifiable factual basis.' The applicants had presented quotes from a book by the AFD politician and press reports to the court.” (End of Quotation)

"10","POSITIVE","I dare to predict that Mr Höcke will still have a great political future!"
"11","NEGATIVE","No, he didn't!"
"12","NEUTRAL","I dare to predict.
Mr Höcke v.d. AfD will still have a great political future.
He addresses the problems in a clear, simple German and everyone knows what is meant.
In order to understand and interpret this, you do not need to be AfD voters or an AfD member.
Truth is often unbearable for some, but truth remains truth."
"13","POSITIVE","“I dare make a forecast.”

Yeah, that's what you read here often! Is apparently a hobby of yours! ; -)


“Mr. Höcke v.d. AfD will still have a great political future.”

Even at the risk of repeating myself now: NO, he will not!


“He addresses the problems in a clear, simple German and everyone knows what is meant.”

Wrong! He deliberately uses Nazi vocabulary and every Nazi sympathizer is happy about it and, of course, feels approached! I'm sorry. :- (


“To understand and interpret this, you don't need to be AfD voters or an AfD member.”

That's right. It is enough if you are a neo-Nazi or at least a Nazi sympathizer, then as a listener of his speeches, you feel absolutely at ease! I'm sorry. :- (


“Truth is often unbearable for some, but truth remains truth.”

I just say: the truth is certainly unbearable for YOU, but truth remains truth!

"14","POSITIVE","Dr. Kamann, thank you very much for this well-researched article. Now no one can deny that the “white vest” of the AfD has deep brown spots in RLP."
"15","NEGATIVE","I fear that the strategy alone to highlight new links to the radical right-wing scene is not effective in order to get hold of the AFD.
It is closer to reconsider the emotional political dismissal by parliamentary democracy, which allows a certain proportion of decisions that no majority of voters has, and is based on this that retains government power through an ever-different constellation of coalitions."
"16","NEGATIVE","I fear that their idea of a democratic basic order is not exactly conforming to the Constitution..."
"17","NEGATIVE","The AfD might have more than 12% potential if it could clearly delineate itself to the far right. With such “dirty children” in top staff, at least in the West, it won't be anything. This is like the left, which holds 30% in Thuringia, but hardly takes place in the West."
"18","POSITIVE","The question is who the border is located to the very right where. After all, it is already publicly announced that the permissible political spectrum should only be left and that everything else should be actively combated. According to Lucke and Petry, Höcke has now been declared the main enemy. Who would be next? 

However, everyone is completely free to create a party in the recommended way, which they think will achieve 30% or more, instead of advising others to sacrifice their beliefs for such Zückerli. Go ahead! Competition can't hurt. Wish you good luck."
"19","NEGATIVE","But this also shows how difficult it is to find integral people in this party at all."
"20","NEUTRAL","It would be easy if the established wanted to compete with the AfD.
whose arguments would be publicly refuted in a communicative and democratic type,
than to show them the cold shoulder, denounce it and permanently want to brand it as unacceptable right.

Unfortunately, the established ones are not able to do so and rather embarrass themselves to count “wrong” in the plenary's quorum at night, and the AfD was smart enough to see through this “established stupidity”.

For several weeks I have been listening and watching on Phoenix and Youtube the speeches of the AfD and the established, already edifying which strengths and weaknesses on all sides open up there.

M.E very questionable whether among the more than 700 MEPs, the right ones come to the levers and microphones.

Argumentative, the established people do not have much to offer the statements of the AfD.

What one can perceive more and more is hysterical screaming which does not testify to foresight, reasoning and democratic confrontation.

In this way, the arguments of the AfD will not be disproved, but will further promote them."
"21","POSITIVE","Like any young party, the AfD also made formal mistakes and there are combatants who hopefully will leave the party sooner.
On the way there, the AfD still receives my support."
"22","NEGATIVE","How long does the AFD want to keep puppy protection?
They have the majority of academics in the party (deserved in other parties), yet they do not manage to formulate applications formally and to the ground of the GG. 
For me that would definitely be too little after the time"
"23","NEGATIVE","No other party will carry out such investigations. It's really just about not leaving good hair at the party. 
No employment contract is asked about the membership of a party, only the AfD should do that. And now the best thing comes, she does.
In the case of the Greens and the Left, it is not investigated whether the employees belong to the left-wing extremist Antifa.
Because the action against Joachim Paul did not bring the hoped for, namely the damage to the party, all the other candidates are now directly questioned, indecent really indecent."
"24","NEGATIVE","Quote: “With the Greens and the Left, it is not investigated whether the employees belong to the left-wing extremist Antifa.”
Just because we don't report, that doesn't mean that we don't investigate. Maybe nothing was found!"
"25","NEGATIVE","Is the whole thing unappetizing..."
"26","NEGATIVE","Well, the AfD.
What else do you want to say? The Wur visible.
Brand core abandoned in favor of right-wing aussen, far too much remained on the way from Lucke to Hoecke, Weidel, Curio etc.
Somehow pity, but also expose."
"27","NEUTRAL","Peter and Stork have you forgotten..."
