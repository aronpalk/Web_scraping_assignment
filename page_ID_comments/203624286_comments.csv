"1","NEGATIVE","Socialism? Who chooses socialism? Who chooses The Greens? Every voter should read before the election, about socialism/communism and what sorrow it has brought to people."
"2","NEUTRAL","Quote: “With the Greens, women decide whether to debate”

That's probably the famous “equality” that's all the time, right?"
"3","NEUTRAL","Funny is that the women's quota must be at least 50%, i.e. the men's quota may fall below 50% if that is not undemocratic, what is it then?"
"4","NEGATIVE","Oh, yes... and obviously men also voted for this mischief. What do the Greens take??"
"5","POSITIVE","I can't believe it! Not only through this report, no, for about four years now, I have the dull feeling that the so-called women's quota is trying to squeeze out more and more men, especially old white men, and they are now cooked so softly that they let everything happen to them. No wonder these so-called women constantly roar “new men needs the country”. Mrs KGE has been looking forward to it for so long. Go on, do you do the favor, sit quietly on your sofas and look at it from afar - still -"
"6","NEGATIVE","A party that doesn't think of equality is something like that of the 19th century and unelectable for me."
"7","NEUTRAL","Hold it! Isn't the party that opposes the construction of EFH also the same party that wants to fill the country with ever new people?"
"8","NEUTRAL","Yeah, yeah. But that fits together...
It must then also be “compacted” structurally."
"9","NEUTRAL","And they want to fight the climate crisis with feminism! I'll laugh later when it's time..."
"10","NEGATIVE","The water rises and everyone knows the fat floats. The female penalty consists almost exclusively of it. I have to buy swimming wings, not feminists. 
Think why Greenpeace has such problems with American feminists. They don't know if you have to keep them feutch and push them back into the sea.
#freewilly #sarkusmus2 .0 #ich am not but"
"11","POSITIVE","The Greens have rediscovered the ecnomy - suspected of Nobel Prize. I have a scarce estate (apartments). I make it particularly difficult for all who produce (or want to produce) this scarce commodity (taxes on it, bans and bans). However, I expect that I will have a surplus of this good (apartments) in the foreseeable future. Wow!!!"
"12","NEUTRAL","Otherwise, coercive measures will come. Mr Habeck has already expressed his admiration for the strength of the Chinese state in domestic policy."
"13","NEGATIVE","So that's so much that the Robert now always has to ask for permission at the super competent Annalena - aka “the Goblin” if he wants to present new great bans? (*at super competent would have made me almost laugh myself in my pants)"
"14","POSITIVE","I don't know why men should consume more CO2 than women. Even the hair blow-drying is done by women more often and more extensively, also women lie more often than men in the bath, they also freeze faster and therefore the heating is turned higher than in a men's household, women buy more clothes and shoes/bags and use more cosmetics in plastic containers than men, they ride with children to school, kindergarten, occupational therapy or piano lessons, ballet or football club. And not to forget, the women cook and bake, use microwaves, vacuum cleaners and mixers, even mobile phones and PCs. And all this in addition to her work part-time or full-time, just what all this consumes in energy!
During this time, most men, unless they are working as a houseman, sit in the offices fairly climate neutral or work as a bicycle courier or pizza carrier, or as craftsmen to install solar systems on the roofs or to renovate residential buildings in a climate-friendly way. And of course they also build ecological single-family cottages on the meadow for families who cannot afford the elaborate renovation of asbestos contaminated or ice-cold old buildings in the village centre. 
What are we going to abolish in order to get a climate-neutral world? I would say that women first, because then all climate problems have been resolved quickly or quickly."
"15","NEUTRAL","Before we abolish men or women, it would be more practical to abolish the Greens.
Then the CDU/SPD doesn't have to greener itself anymore and you can possibly find a way back to reasonable policy. 
If men have nothing to report, Scholz has to intervene, because that does not agree with his new club rules"
"16","POSITIVE","Very short and concise: unselectable!"
"17","NEGATIVE","Unfortunately, only people who use their heads not only for hair cutting prefer Andy and this is unfortunately no longer the case with a part of our population, when I look at the rates of approval for the Greens."
"18","NEUTRAL","When are the Green Women going to enforce a decision that men can only become members after their dismantling?"
"19","POSITIVE","Mrs Göring-E: 'this country will change drastically and I look forward to it'. God save this land"
"20","NEGATIVE","If it weren't such a mourning game, I'd have to laugh loudly. To such a kindergarten adult people give their voice?. next comes: etsch bätsch fallen in, or what? Abstrus the whole thing. In ridiculousness it is hard to beat!!!!"
"21","POSITIVE","Please do not forget about the other nursery, the SPD. With (Ätschi) Bätschi you have already given the right keyword."
"22","NEGATIVE","Schdae that mischief like this pretended quota dön (this is discrimination of purest water, green primordial fundi feminism moth box), these completely absurd building resolutions or even the decision to recognise climate change as a reason for escape in the future were not made more publicly publicly in the media. This would be helpful for the trend voters who have migrated to the Greens in the climate hype, to see what they choose when Germany saves the planet by means of Robolena Baerbeck. After all, much will be more expensive (especially normal life), there will be no longer any freedoms exercised for years, jobs will fall away. For this, I have to ask my colleague if I can say anything else, and soon I will have to completely rebuild my old house because of heating and stuff. Residential property has always been overrated, especially in the countryside.

I am very excited about the survey figures so in two weeks, when the information from this event has spread, and it is important to note that the youthful, freshly bubbled leadership duo leads an equally dogmatic bunch as the primal Greens have always been. Looks hip and liberal, but it's the opposite!"
"23","NEGATIVE","I do not believe that the issues that could worsen the survey values will be exhibited by the green liberal media in Germany (that is, almost all). At the primetime, the ÖR will again be in cheering about this lovely leadership duo and hide things that are criticized by the ordinary citizen in the late news."
"24","NEGATIVE","I would instead build an apartment building and rent the remaining 2-3 apartments, but landlords don't like the left either."
"25","NEGATIVE","They're supposed to build the apartment building. After that, they'll be expropriated anyway!"
"26","NEUTRAL","“With the amendment now adopted, men will in future be excluded from the decision to continue the debate, in which the women present do not express any further interest: “If the list of women is exhausted, the women of the Assembly must be asked whether the debate should continue. “”

Is that the other way around? Or will the green man in the future have to fight for equality, which he previously abandoned as a “gentleman”?"
"27","NEUTRAL","Of course not, the new rule prefers only further and unilaterally one sex: “The regulation “If the list of women is exhausted, the Assembly must ask whether 
the debate is to be continued.” of Article 2 (1) of the Women's Statute is amended to: “Is 
exhausted the list of women, the women of the assembly must be questioned whether the 
Debate should be continued. '

There is probably no other party where sex has as much influence as the Greens."
"28","NEGATIVE","As truly sexist, racier and environmental disturbing, they become enemies of the Otto ordinary consummers. Visioners who know no measure or center. delusion replaces reason."
"29","NEGATIVE","Unfortunately, many do not see or understand."
"30","NEUTRAL","So let it melt again on the tongue. If a woman is angry with a debate, then is the end of the debate? Where is justice? Such a party would be unelectable for me as a man."
"31","NEGATIVE","For me as a man, as a father of children and as an electric car driver and nature preservation also completely unselectable."
"32","NEUTRAL","So, bad cards for Habeck and chancellor candidacy he supports the patriarchy as a man."
"33","NEUTRAL","From “prohibit and block” to “shape and govern”. I think this is going to be a very lengthy process.

Habeck, “Prohibitions are part of freedom”. 
I think that rather “rules”, under which understanding shape, order, direct, belong to “freedom”, or to the liberal system.
Prohibitions can be part of these “rules”. Partially, “rules” are reduced to prohibitions. However, the ban seems to be the simplest form of a “rule”, design, order and, in terms of “freedom”, is more likely to be problematic.

It is questionable, however, what form of “freedom” should be designed for the Greens. 
This article gives an interesting insight.

Habeck, “I don't want to have any unique selling points”, “what we're doing right now is to radiate an optimistic, passionate confidence, not to make out so much about us,” “to focus on the topics and with the optimism, it can succeed in looking forward and then perhaps taking a few people away.” 
The success concept “Merkel”? 
Many parties seem to be adopting a similar approach at the moment."
"34","NEUTRAL","I would like to be interested: How do they actually live (especially the party leader)? All in small apartments in apartment buildings?"
"35","NEUTRAL","The mass has two apartments: see Annalena Baerbock - a beautiful detached house in the green and for her activities in Berlin an expensive apartment in a prime location. At Habeck it will be the same: a house in the green in Schleswig-Holstein and apartment in Berlin.

Drinking wine - preaching water - is just GREEN double standard."
"36","NEUTRAL","Green mischief in the highest perfection. >Dear Greens: What should they do in the future would be cheaper for the basuen than staying in rent. Living in the tent?"
"37","NEGATIVE","As long as they dump taxes, the Greens do not care how they live. The tent would certainly be one of the freedoms of which the Greens speak from time to time."
"38","NEUTRAL","One is simply relieved after these party congress resolutions - finally the radical fundamentalists have prevailed again with the GREEN and the GREEN INSIDES have dropped their mask: 

Massive increase in CO2 tax, restriction of freedom of expression for men, ban on single-family homes, basic right for a housing paid by the welfare state for “new citizens” in the Basic Law, a future unsafe electricity supply based on the import of electricity from abroad and leading to temporal rationing and power barriers will be.

For anyone who still has a little sense, some property and a job in the value-adding part of the economy, or is just male, the GREEN are thus completely unselectable."
"39","POSITIVE","Well then I'm looking forward to the next government! 
There is such a Bulgarian saying: “What you do to yourself does not make the whole village when it comes together!”
Just keep on dialing..."
"40","NEUTRAL","Have the ÖR announced the new green ideas loudly in the evening before?
If yes, I'm looking forward to the next survey;)"
"41","NEGATIVE","No, in this case the ÖR makes a media exception and does not report on the Greens. They are pampered by the media every day, but in this case it's better to keep the ball flat. It can't be what can't be."
"42","NEUTRAL","At least 50% of delegated places awarded to women! Even if there are probably none who want the post!
1. There may be more. Men could be disadvantaged, women should not be.
2. Having a vagina brings more than competence.

It often seems to me that a few people are sitting with the Greens and wondering: How can we scare as many voters as possible with the ability to think independently?"
"43","POSITIVE","It's just amazing how many there are still, who are not capable of doing so."
"44","NEGATIVE","Typical green:
City developers have long seen the single-family house critically. But this applies ONLY to areas in the building land is scarce and expensive. Here it is already entitled to poke on double or multi-family houses. But therefore it is not necessary to prohibit it in general. The market regulates that itself anyway. In these locations, no one builds single-family homes because it is priceless.

The debate on resource consumption is great. I'd like to see the numbers underlying this. According to the fire regulations, the partition between semi-detached houses must be double bricked. Insulation is also introduced between the two individual walls. The ratio of useful to roof area is the same. OKAY, OKAY. You save the linking of a building side. What does that matter? 5% of the mass of the house?"
"45","NEUTRAL","You actually save nothing but a second heating system. The “advantage” of semi-detached houses is only to look for the fact that you can put more house on a smaller plot. But the window itself is only a political size."
"46","NEUTRAL","So, in green, men can only talk if women allow them. 
We already know the other way around in MiHi circles.
If this is feminism, what is sexism?"
"47","NEUTRAL","Ask for help: what is/are Mihi?"
"48","POSITIVE","God save us from storm and wind - and from greens, so that they will never be in government!"
"49","POSITIVE","I'll say “good night” Germany, if they really put the new chancellor!"
"50","NEGATIVE","Green Chancellor does not go at all, he can't talk without permission and Robert can't ask Annalena first every time 
and she can't answer because she's looking for the power in the socket.
So would remain only Chancellor again."
"51","NEUTRAL","If the voters give this party the opportunity to implement their plans, then Germany also deserves what will become of it. But I'm already saying that after four years we will have a government that will beat the other extreme.

The single-family house restriction is taken directly from the socialist manual, as well as investment restrictions. It's all about shifting the limits of what is said until no one cares anymore. Twenty years ago, every party had been chased out of the Reichstag, which even hinted at wanting to determine where and how people have to live.

It's time for the middle to clear against any extremes 
and the last one must understand that you always choose an overall package. Even among the Greens, there are sensible people, but they will not be able to prevail against the positions of the extreme left."
"52","NEUTRAL","“the middle” chooses the Greens, take a look at the election results in the neighborhoods of the “better-earners” in Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Hamburg, Munich or Cologne..."
"53","NEGATIVE","Eggs only from free-range farming, but in humans the battery may already be."
"54","NEUTRAL","If it concerns men, then the soil keeping for green in any case is more than sufficient. The diet between feathered cattle and humans is also expected to be approaching more and more."
"55","POSITIVE","Mrs Göring-E: 'this country will change drastically and I look forward to it'. 
God save this land"
"56","NEUTRAL","Michael S
If you trust Gitt, it may take some time.
And if he's interfering?
I've been trying the alternative since 2013. The only one in the rest, because all the others are so green on the left."
"57","NEGATIVE","Are sand and gravel already threatened with extinction? Or what resources should be conserved? But was this really a serious party congress or an early carnival event? In view of the thinness that seemed to have been seriously discussed and decided, one should have carried out an alcohol and drug test on the participants afterwards..."
"58","POSITIVE","Yes sand and gravel are rare earths.
Are mined like “goblin” by poor children in the Congo. E-car batteries are full of it. Besides, all this is now needed for Tesla in Brandenburg."
"59","NEUTRAL","whether these greens also know that for the construction of a single wind turbine about 50 tons of steel and about 350 tons of concrete are installed for the foundation! Any questions?"
"60","NEUTRAL","Priorities have to be set.
Of course, you can build houses from the material for the wind turbines, but it is not the ideological goal. In the GDR, the material for the wall could also have been used to build or repair houses.
At that time, as today, the use of the material has been or is repeatedly subordinated to ideological goals and priorities."
"61","NEUTRAL","How can a group with such ideas be 20% in polls? I just don't understand."
"62","MIXED","Because they are pushed massively by the mass media instead of critically questioned. The media makers are mostly so polarized and unfortunately not a representative cross-section of the population, so they have to be re-educated with all the tricks that the social psychologists have thought up for this."
"63","NEUTRAL","Yes, the Greens are now making their programme according to their own ideas. With the CDU/CSU, the SPD and the FDP, only one further would be so announced in the future. If they create chancellors at the next election, they simply have the opportunity to show that they are doing better with their content. The quality of their ideas will then no longer be decided argumentatively, but in the case of the chancellor on the basis of their practicality and their late success."
"64","NEUTRAL","They would be sure of success with their methods - I know from the past, there was the 'plan overfulfillment'."
"65","POSITIVE","-No more own house allowed (disgusting toxic masculine egoists) 
-Men, beautifully submissive and rightless (always two steps behind the woman, with black fully enveloping feminist burka) 

... Likeable party
😂😂"
"66","NEGATIVE","Maybe it's time to start a men's party.
Just won't get any money, because Scholz will ban it.
But with enough men and contributions, this is already going on.
Men-like women are allowed to become passive members and support men.
Hahahahaha"
"67","NEUTRAL","The Greens are completely discriminating against the various!
So to speak, Bigfoot plunges into his own gender gap..."
"68","NEUTRAL","Habeck has always been able to practice as a strong, well-established man image for his desired chancellor time."
"69","NEUTRAL","Ralph L,
If he was to become Chancellor, would he have to ask Anna-Lena before each decision to be taken, how and whether he could decide?"
"70","NEUTRAL","The more power and influence are given to the Greens, the faster Germany is going against the wall.
The fact that the economy is not boosted by a policy of prohibition and patronage does not seem to have reached the Greens yet, as is the case that our social market economy is primarily based on free entrepreneurship and smart, moderately regulating policies. 
It remains to be hoped that the great crowd of green voters will not give their voice to this madness."
"71","NEGATIVE","Sounds not like adult, enlightened, responsible, people, but rather of sociology proseminar, first semester..."
"72","NEUTRAL","Have you seen the video of the Democratic Socialists of America convention? This is the future of the Green Party Congress"
"73","NEUTRAL","“We are socialists, we are enemies of today's capitalist
economic order for the exploitation of the economically weak, with their
unfair salaries, with their evaluation of a person by wealth and
possession, rather than responsibility and performance, and we are all determined to
to destroy this system in all conditions.”"
"74","NEGATIVE","What are those men in the party who vote for women to say the absolute thing.
So it won't be with many Turkish members"
"75","NEUTRAL","“If the women's replete list is exhausted, the women of the Assembly must be asked whether the debate should continue. “

Did they actually limit this to women? What happens if the men's talk list is exhausted? Isn't that happening?"
"76","NEGATIVE","Then the women continue to drool. They seem to be allowed to let off steam verbally without limitation. According to the latest green doctrine, it seems that only men continue to have a discussion. For women, however, this is quite different."
"77","POSITIVE","It's not a problem. I think it's good!
Since the decisions of the Party Congress, it should be 100% clear that Baerbock and not Habeck will become the chancellor candidate of the Green Women.
However, this should also ensure that the election result is again in the direction of 10% rather than 20%."
"78","NEUTRAL","“If the women's replete list is exhausted, the women of the Assembly must be asked whether the debate should continue. “

Isn't that contrary to the law of equality?"
"79","NEUTRAL","When at last the economic bosses will rebel! With this party, Germany is in the Stone Age in 15 years at the latest!"
"80","POSITIVE","but you have a very positive opinion."
"81","POSITIVE","The green skewers certainly do not find it difficult to impede the construction of new single-family houses. They protect their property."
"82","NEGATIVE","And be it just the feudal holiday home in Tuscany... Wherever the green, of course with the cheap airline, because you don't feel like 20 hours by train."
"83","NEGATIVE","“Equality” by decree... is it really what women want? I don't think so.
My granddaughter told me on request: I'm a doctor, done. The doctors who insist on the emphasis are simply of the opinion of being a woman in spite of the fact that they have become a doctor. My granddaughter sees this quite untense and smiles mildly at such ladies."
"84","NEUTRAL","As a doctor, woman is in a position in which woman can afford it. If she were a saleswoman, she would certainly have a different perspective on it."
"85","POSITIVE","Mrs Göring-E: 'this country will change drastically and I look forward to it'.

God save this land"
"86","NEUTRAL","He's been giving it up for a long time."
"87","NEUTRAL","As Obelix used to say - tock, tock, tock."
"88","POSITIVE","Genius! This will increase the value of my EFH. So I have a higher proceeds if I leave the country in a few years."
"89","NEGATIVE","The problem is, however, who will/can buy the house then?"
"90","POSITIVE","I know some greens with beautiful detached houses. I think they show solidarity with the party congresses and sell their houses."
"91","NEGATIVE","Sell? Unsolidarity...!!! This should be given away or at least the profit invested in the next toad, salamander or similarly inspired project. Profit-free of course.."
"92","POSITIVE","If I consider that the Germans, for their demographic development alone, would create all the targets and goals of the Greens (including climate protection) in themselves in a playful way and would not achieve them only because, last but not least, the Greens insist on flooding this country with immigrants into our social systems, then I come to the conclusion that the Greens are dealing with problems that we would not have without them. Thanks to the robots in our factories and the low taxes, we could all live in single-family homes and drive with our SUVs - thanks to nuclear power - through beautiful, untouched natural landscapes and fly to Malle or Florida several times a year without even having to worry about CO2."
"93","NEUTRAL","“He said to Jehovah!”"
"94","NEUTRAL","Planet of women and those who would like to be..."
"95","NEUTRAL","I want you to call me Loretta from now on."
"96","NEGATIVE","The rules of discussion seem to me anti-constitutional. That should be forbidden."
"97","POSITIVE","130 km/h on motorways.
Sexism towards men.
Prohibition on single-family homes.

Thank you that was the coffin nail I needed to never vote for this party!"
"98","NEGATIVE","If you chose them before, you already had all the coffin nails."
"99","NEUTRAL","They're a case for the protection of the Constitution, otherwise not. Goblin hunter, Damish."
"100","POSITIVE","Hahaha, I think the family houses are good. By the way, I also like to talk to the left, right living couples living in 150sqm in the uninsulated single-family house and criticize my preference for cool cars, while four of us inhabit 100sqm in a KfW 55 apartment building. Their Co2 footprint is higher than mine!
I don't understand why the Greens are suddenly making politics against their core target group “talk on the left, live on the right”, but I am delighted twice."
"101","NEUTRAL","But the space requirement of unsealed soil must also apply to wind turbines and not just residential buildings, right?"
"102","NEGATIVE","Gender neutral discussions and common dealings with each other are alien to the Greens. NO, YOU MUSN ALWAYtimes set to split. Further: “We don't want to forbid building a family house”, but we make it so difficult that no one can do it anymore. A party that is on prohibitions, patronization, and ultimately totalitarian. But they themselves have everything conceivable desirable, only the mob must not have or do that."
"103","NEUTRAL","If your first sentence wasn't, I'd agree with you."
"104","NEUTRAL","Where's our finance minister here? According to his logic, even parties which dispose of democratic elections by the fact that 50% of the population are not eligible for certain positions should be deprived of the general benefit and the donation of party funds."
"105","NEGATIVE","I am really horrified by this party and do not understand why the minimum wage is not differentiated. Unfortunately, we have to hire student support in the gastronomy, who now have no idea of anything and need months to work reasonably productive: This is not worth €12! 
Good people, I like to pay for it even without training, but the turnover has to be there, otherwise the shop is no longer financiable. Taxes, energy costs, etc. etc. are becoming more and more. Everything controlled by politics! Now CO2 tax - we can't constantly increase our prices! I pay 1500€per month electricity! (no EEG levy exemption like companies!).
I'm puking to always be portrayed as an exploitor - in our industry you can't earn much anymore and is automatically a millionaire at the expense of the employees. That could be 30 years ago!
The Greens do not know at all how much the middle class in Germany contributes to economic strength! 
Why? Because people like Habeck and Baerbock and many other politicians have never worked in a company of the free economy in their lives!"
"106","NEUTRAL","An important article! Their morality, their arrogance, the Greens carry before them like a monstrance, their concepts consist exclusively of prohibitions, prohibitions and prohibitions, and if they could, they would determine what we have to think, do and leave."
"107","NEUTRAL","Make it today about the left-wing press highness"
"108","POSITIVE","These must be the children of the previous generation. They smoked a lot back then. I cannot explain this increase in ideas differently."
"109","NEGATIVE","Here it is again: the Greens want to destroy the dreams and ways of life of the Germans.
This time: the detached house.
But I like to live in my family home, and my neighbors too, because it creates exactly the distance to the other that you need to not get on your nerves.
When it comes to space and recources, stop bringing millions of people to this country who will never contribute positively to our economy."
"110","NEUTRAL","I think for the big cities of Germany the best housing concept would be the quarters and housing allocation according to m². 30-40m² per person should be enough. Anyone who lives on more as a single then gets assigned to whom."
"111","POSITIVE","You have to take a closer look at the women. The men fit exactly with that. 

Therefore, there are no questions left for me."
"112","NEGATIVE","... nevertheless, more than 20% want to elect this party and its program. The main problem is that most voters do not adequately deal with the parties' programs and think drawers in large mass media. Greens stand for the world, AFD are far-right, CDU is bourgeois conservative, etc... Fortunately, most readers here know better."
"113","NEGATIVE","I suspect that many of the Green voters are protest voters (just not those who know...), otherwise they cannot be explained in terms of their program or politics."
"114","POSITIVE","There are very often academics, so those people with the best education in the country"
"115","NEGATIVE","We have GSD freedom of expression, but whoever chooses it is not to help."
"116","NEUTRAL","I wonder how a man with a spark of self-esteem can choose this party. And what are these men who vote in favour of such proposals among the Greens?"
"117","NEUTRAL","They are probably men who want a society in which women really have the same power as men, i.e. 50% are represented on board boards, party committees, Bundestag and supervisory boards."
"118","NEGATIVE","I'm sorry, this isn't gender, that's sexist!"
"119","NEGATIVE","Another important decision of the party day: (I heard it on Sunday evening on the radio, but not found it in the newspaper, the end of the combustion engine by 2030 (!!!) : Quote from Watson.de: “From 2030 at the latest, only emission-free cars should be left, for which the charging infrastructure should be expanded and standardized. The Greens also plead for model projects on car-free city centres and city toll. In ten municipalities they want to try out free public transport (public transport). In order to make the energy transition socially fair, purchase price premiums, for example for electric cars, are expected to be larger in lower price segments than in higher ones. Electricity barriers would have to be avoided in people with low income.” 
How is this supposed to work in the big cities - only e-cars? Where shall they all be charged, where shall the electricity come from? These questions must be asked before Germany shuts down itself."
"120","NEUTRAL","A party of prohibitions, regulations and demands that should best be subjected to without resistance. Where does the individual stay when everyone has to agree?"
"121","NEUTRAL","I'm asking myself one more question. What happens when only women are on the list of speakers. Let the men decide..."
"122","NEGATIVE","If they only have women, this party owns the subsidies cancelled, just as Scholzes Olaf would have liked to have had in the pure men's associations."
"123","NEGATIVE","The Greens adduced for the 3rd sex, different. That would only be consistent to take this into account in the speeches. This would reduce the number of speeches to a minimum, provided, of course, that 'it' is against."
"124","NEUTRAL","Is it not discrimination against men or does it no longer matter?"
"125","NEUTRAL","Mrs Göring-E: 'this country will change drastically and I look forward to it'."
"126","POSITIVE","Ms. G.E. is the specialist in public dreaming. I don't want to disturb her in her dreams."
"127","NEUTRAL","So democracy is what women want? Well, thank you. No Way..."
"128","NEUTRAL","Politicians are a profession in which women usually can't do anything sensible.

On the other hand, for example, kindergarten teacher is a wonderful profession for women, where usually everything is done right."
"129","POSITIVE","Detached houses are ecologically valuable if the garden is properly laid out. I would rather promote planting and natural gardens."
"130","POSITIVE","Multi-family houses with gardens are also available."
"131","NEGATIVE","“If the women's list of speech is exhausted, the women of the Assembly must be asked whether the debate should continue.”

You're speechless. They should ever ask the Federal Chancellor not imagine what this party can think of."
"132","NEUTRAL","This party is a case for the psychiatrist."
"133","NEGATIVE","But something like that... as much cheese as I've heard about them in the last 20 years doesn't go on cow skin. But the German landscape is so disgraced with the wind and birds shredding machines that only tears come to you."
"134","NEGATIVE","The Greens cannot contribute to the serious problems that Germany has. The basic skills of students in the fields of math and German are becoming less and less. Diarse infrastructure. Marode Bundeswehr. Industrial jobs are being dismantled. Social systems are becoming increasingly burdened. Old-age poverty.
And what can happen to the Greens: if women do not have arguments or ideas, they will no longer be discussed. It can't be more undemocratic."
"135","NEUTRAL","A kindergarten, on the other hand, is a college!"
"136","NEUTRAL","If Habeck hadn't ironed some things away, the outcome of this party convention would probably be even more influenced by the character of the 68-ies and Old Communists. They do not stop until they have prevailed the primitive communism and we live again in caves."
"137","NEUTRAL","Clearly, the Greens have finally adopted the democratic principle.
With planned economy, a huge and desired downturn will come.
It is planned economy, whether I write eco and social or anything before it."
"138","NEUTRAL","” The construction of single-family houses is to be made more difficult because they needed too much space and resources. “

Is this a stimulus plan for the future AfD voter potential?

How to interpret the following:

” Increasingly new single-family homes on the green meadow drive the use of land and lead to empty and dull village centres in many places at the same time “

DO NOT go into the countryside, but rent something in the town centre? Best in the high-rise building, there are many residential units on a small footprint?

This 8.9% opposition party has been mercilessly jazzed up in the media since 2017 and written into a government responsibility. 
Expertise and sense of reality do not seem to have to be a basis."
"139","NEUTRAL","So that's why I certainly don't choose the AfD."
"140","POSITIVE","The house.
Favorite child of the Germans.
Actually, there should be an outcry.
I also assume that 70% are green people.
Feminism goes well beyond democratic action."
"141","POSITIVE","It's important that it's not the best choice, but the women. And prefabricated buildings are beautiful as long as they belong to a woman. Maybe we build a wall again and call the country behind it DFR, then the girls can hold and switch as they want and everyone who wants stays. Let's see if they can last longer than the GDR."
"142","NEUTRAL","Parts of our decisions SHOULD concern the population - that's the alternative reading..."
"143","NEGATIVE","“Germany will change...”
And I'm NOT looking forward to it."
"144","NEUTRAL","Of the previous 27 percent in the polls, these are now far away, but 19 percent would currently vote for this party. How can that be, who can explain this to me???"
"145","POSITIVE","Some of them certainly find Annalena and Robert just hip and cool, with the rest I don't understand..."
"146","POSITIVE","Well, at least there will soon be batteries for electric cars without a leprechaun..."
"147","NEUTRAL","How long can you actually enjoy a spokesman?"
"148","NEUTRAL","Socialism in its course, neither ox nor donkey stop. The Greens as Stirrup Holder by Marx and Honecker."
"149","NEUTRAL","If a politician says he never intends, we know what's coming out! Ulbricht said it days before the wall construction too!!!"
"150","NEGATIVE","And in my city is the provisional roundabout of the 3 months for a major event should stay also meanwhile 6 years old and brakes the main road super off!"
"151","NEGATIVE","Whether every green voter is really aware of what he chooses?
The Greens are planning an eco-socialism of the finest, including residential silos with small apartments.
They want to tell people how to live. They do not (yet) do it by means of prohibitions, but want to make the behaviour wrong from their point of view so expensive that one can no longer afford them. Come out on the same thing. 
And as far as feminism is concerned, they want to move away from a male-dominated society to a woman-dominated society. They come up with the idea and demand that women have to earn more to make up for the gender pay gap of the past.
Grace us God if the Greens actually take the lead."
"152","NEUTRAL","The Greens are now in government in Brandenburg. Let's see how they deal with the gender pay gap. In Brandenburg, women earn significantly more in several regions (partly up to 20%!) than the men. In order for women to reach the often widespread gap of 21% in these regions, some of their incomes would have to be almost halved."
"153","NEGATIVE","'If the list of women is exhausted, the women of the Assembly must be asked whether the debate should continue. ' 

As a man, you have to be extremely masochistic disposition to want to belong to such a party."
"154","NEUTRAL","Yeah, but some men pay a lot of money to be dominated."
"155","NEUTRAL","Violation of Art. 3 GG, which comes into effect here because parties according to Art. 21 GG must comply with “democratic principles”. In addition, a violation of the AGG is possible, and that should be examined.
A very clear case for the protection of the Constitution!"
