"1","NEUTRAL","The Greens have not understood how an economy works. They are almost aiming for a planned economy, if this party comes into government responsibility, then the lid is closed. Germany is at a crossroads, and the Greens will certainly not advance this country but to the Stone Age."
"2","POSITIVE","Na great, the economic program of the Diplom-Economist Habeck and the Dipl. Industrial Engineer Kobold-Baerbock can only become ingenious."
"3","POSITIVE","Na great, the economic program of the Diplom-Economist Habeck and the Dipl. Industrial Engineer Kobold-Baerbock can only be genial."
"4","POSITIVE","Anyone who does not consume anything (produces everything himself, what he needs) benefits the most. And if he gets something back from the pot, he can even earn. A large part of the economy is driven either into bankruptcy or abroad. There will definitely be beautiful distortions of the markets. I am already looking forward to the consequences today. But I don't think that won't prevail. It's better that way."
"5","NEGATIVE","A redistribution story. Most benefit those who do not need a car, little/not heat at all, never fly, do everything on foot or by bike or skateboard, never eat meat, hardly eat anything at all, at all chew/never consume, but get something back tax (lower income layers). It's a reward system for total waiver. The catch: Not everyone manages to repolate on total renunciation. Those who do not (want) do this should be in the majority. Those who have a very high income will continue as before. It doesn't itch when heating costs, consumption, flight costs double. But they won't get anything back. Apart from that, really benefit do of course all those who earn on this remodeling."
"6","NEUTRAL","You did not make your bill with the mass of pensioners who do not pay taxes.
If pensioners and pensioners, i.e. about 30 million voters, knew how politically strong they would be if they were to join forces, green fantasies, among other parties, would not have a chance."
"7","NEUTRAL","What is “climate policy” supposed to be? What should a policy address a problem that Germany (and all other countries) could never solve? We should go inside ourselves and turn back to a meaningful policy so that the future prospects become more rosy again. The beginning would be to remove Greens from responsible positions and deal with areas of responsibility where they cannot do any harm."
"8","NEGATIVE","However, there would not be many areas where the phankeys would be used."
"9","MIXED","The Greens have now clearly set out what their policies should look like in the coming years. One can get upset about it, or not, the decisive factor is whether the electorate can and wants to afford this programme. It is undoubted that it will be expensive for every citizen. How many can't afford it remains unanswered. The Greens may have an eye on the climate, at least not the ordinary citizens with a narrow purse. I dare doubt whether majorities can be formed in this way. Even now, many citizens can no longer pay the electricity bill. The number of real famines is so drastically increased. In one year, preparations for elections for the next Bundestag election will begin. If there is no normality until then, the BTW could lead to a big surprise. The three state elections in the new Länder were obviously not warning enough."
"10","POSITIVE","You have to leave one thing to the Greens, they stay true to each other. If the voters elect them, they'll get that policy too. There are also people who want a life like the Amemish people. Let everyone decide for themselves. The fun stops when you want to tell others how much CO2 they can exhale, how much beans they can eat per year."
"11","NEUTRAL","I predict that just before the next BT election green will again be just below 10%.

First of all, let the citizens feel the air tax associated with increased energy, electricity, gasoline, diesel, fuel oil, increased rents, etc., then they will wake up in their minds and turn green into a diabolo."
"12","NEGATIVE","I hope you're right. Nothing can be worse than the green or the left in a government."
"13","NEGATIVE","Greens are the great danger for Germany as a business location.
Green policy will be very expensive for us citizens.
Greens want to patronize us citizens and prohibit us.
Green belongs in forest and field, by no means in decisive politics.
For me, what comes from green is often irrational and far away the ratio and financiability."
"14","NEGATIVE","but nevertheless this party is hyped and elected - incomprehensible"
"15","NEGATIVE","Posters paint and demonstrate does not save penguins. Technical progress does. Poverty kills more people than climate, and market economy has - proven - led more people out of poverty than any other systems. Nuclear power plants are CO2 neutral, diesel cars are CO2 friendlier than gasoline. So what do you want? Green means socialism in camouflage, I'm afraid. In China, Russia, the GDR, North Korea, Cambodia and Venezuela, socialist systems have murdered 100th of millions of people in the last century, and have made them starve even more. And where is the green attitude against the real murderers in the communist and socialist dictatorships? Do we want Berlin relations?"
"16","POSITIVE","Penguins live at the South Pole, they are safe for the first time. Maybe you mean polar bears? Unfortunately, it doesn't look so good for them."
"17","NEGATIVE","Expensive, which has no alternative, THAT is antisocial! Heating energy, large vehicles, aircraft, transit traffic on land, on water and in the air, all of which are (yet) not available with electricity. They will continue to pollut the environment, despite rising prices. What is the point in? Has anyone ever thought about where all the green electricity should come from to replace the combustion? Today, our power grids are already shaky and only expensive to keep base load capable. And all this, so that Germany contributes 0.6% to global CO2 consumption. The whole spook is overtaken in its effectiveness on the left and right by the immense increase in energy consumption in Africa, Asia and South America, where the mere population growth is placing an increasing burden on the environment every year, not to mention their growing economies. 'Cause they keep burning cheerfully."
"18","POSITIVE","So from 2030 no more internal combustion engines. The question immediately arises how the police, the fire brigade. THW should still fulfill your mission. Now completely apart from all the construction machinery and trucks, I'm looking forward to the first bulldozer with battery.

I am also looking forward to the first campers, towing vehicles for caravans and motorcycles which are operated with a battery.

As always, the Greens show that they are completely unleavened by reality and have no idea, but abundant."
"19","NEUTRAL","And the complete transit traffic is routed around Germany."
"20","NEUTRAL","Got the info on the electricity price increase.
What was that, CO2 pricing should be reduced to consumers by reducing electricity costs?
Attracts yellow vests and does not dial green."
"21","NEGATIVE","still the 20% of the population has not seen the head in the sand and the remaining 80% the effects of green-red blinding. 

Too many are still too well and consumerism keeps them under steam, 
but this may change soon if the announced facts of job cuts, industrial emigration, etc.

Never in my many years of life have I experienced such blindness and naivety in this population and one grasps the head with what blindness 
one tries to save the world climate on the small area of the Federal Republic of Germany, to push other states to the same economic murder and to lead the continent of Europe into the Middle Ages.

Oh, Lord, to whom have you entrusted the scepter of mass anesthesia?"
"22","NEUTRAL","The AFD can do what it wants and if even the biggest studs squat there, the citizens choose them in flocks, because the parties outbid each other to cup and patronize the citizen more and more."
"23","NEUTRAL","“Greens adopt economic program with eco-rules for the market”
This has existed before in the GDR, as we all know, did not prevail and the economy was on the ground after the shortest time."
"24","NEGATIVE","is this system not already tightly on the way to DDR2.0???
I think many signs in the FRG policy show this clearly."
"25","NEUTRAL","Once again, a green signal is coming from Bielefeld. This also applies to the time before fishermen. The long time red Bielefeld was one of the first municipalities in which there was a red-green majority in the city council. The left-oriented eco-moralism, which was already pronounced at that time, followed the Bielefeld population so much that a long period with CDU majority was followed. It will be exciting for Germany how the political maps will be remixed over the next few years in view of the continuing downgrading of security and freedom levels and now also starting from the level of prosperity and in the face of a sustainably changing population structure. The established parties, including the Greens, will probably hold little trumps in their hands."
"26","NEGATIVE","So if I eat meat or bezin fuel now I have to pay a CO2 price, which is then returned directly to. Can somebody make sense to me?"
"27","NEGATIVE","Above all, it costs tons of administrative costs. I do not see generating a sense other than new government revenues and driving the lesser earner even more into poverty."
"28","NEUTRAL","Don Alphonso once reported here that the Green Lists are using their critics, “climate deniers” and people who think differently. On demand, they even had to admit that. How to choose such a party?"
"29","NEUTRAL","A CO2 tax already exists. All taxes are indirectly related to CO2, because CO2 is emit by any type of consumption. Whether it is VAT when buying a product - the production of this product went only through CO2 releasing mechanisms. Or wage tax, because with the wage, in turn, products that release CO2 are bought.
So it's just a tax increase in new packaging.
Ergo would be a taxation of 80 percent, followed by the destruction of money, especially eco."
"30","NEUTRAL","Millions of imports from abroad continue to be the highest beneficiaries of CO2.
Does anybody think of taxation in this regard?"
"31","POSITIVE","Higher minimum wage so that the CO2 tax can also be paid... 

Very nice! 

(head table...)"
"32","NEUTRAL","Lower diets for politicians! So that they can feel the CO2 control. :D"
"33","NEGATIVE","'No new passenger cars with internal combustion engines' from 2030 

2030 is way too late. The combustion engines should be destroyed by the end of 2020. And if you can't afford an electric car, you should drive a train, a bike or an electric scooter."
"34","NEGATIVE","If I see them in the photo, I only think of Abott & Costello, which is an insult to the two actors. Because they earned their money with good acting and not like Bärhabockbeck with blinding. These two are political zeros of first class."
"35","NEGATIVE","I understand more and more that there are people who want to take a path (I am explicitly referring to the Greens voters) that are more and more incomprehensible. As an example, I would cry climate policy. CO2 binders, i.e. forests or tree settlements are cut down so that the “propellers” can be installed. Whole “football fields” are cut down. Tons of concrete are poured into holes so that these “windmills” can be erected. However, if there is no wind blowing, no electricity will be produced. Then electricity must or will be bought at the electricity exchange. If too much wind blows to produce too much electricity, it will be given away abroad. For the operators of the “windmills” this is not a loss, everything is paid by the taxpayer (see EEG).
Few greens travel through the area exclusively with electric cars. On vacation is flown. Long distances are handled with service cars. Etc., etc.
At some point, it seems that only one aspect remains. Save to settle in another state at age (at the age of 63 at the latest) and then enjoy life again.
With all due respect, but why this “prohibition party” finds voters is no longer open to me."
"36","POSITIVE","I hope that the AFD will still be able to prevent this disaster. Supplementary donation is out!"
"37","NEUTRAL","60€ per ton. The average citizen needs 12 tons per year. 12*60€=720€ extra load per year. 
The Greens are the party of the better operators, if not the best earners."
"38","NEUTRAL","I got the weekend post from the electricity provider and there was nothing good in it
I make my own opinion as long as this is not forbidden yet"
"39","POSITIVE","@Helga M.
Recognizes well; this is the reality."
"40","NEGATIVE","The demands and ideas of the Greens are totally irreal and economic and consumer harmful. No more combustion engines until 2030 (if that's true!)? How's that going to work? It's good that the FDP has broken down the Jamaica negotiations. With these Greens, one can only rule “wrong”. One grasps your head and can't believe that this party gets so much encouragement in the polls. Where are the big media that really feel critical of this party? “Prohibitions are also part of freedom” - what does that mean? You can't get it!"
"41","NEUTRAL","“Prohibitions are also part of freedom” 
Genius isn't it? Freedom is slavery, war means peace!"
"42","NEUTRAL","The vast majority in the forum here obviously see the Beelzebub in these Greens. However, these commentators would have to answer three questions:

1) if not CO2 tax, recycling quotas and renewable energies: what do YOU propose instead to get global warming under control?

2) The Greens have always been argued to discuss ecology in vacuum. Now they accept the challenge of sketching the social whole, not an easy undertaking in their protest party tradition. How can YOU help you make this sketch better?

3) YOU do not want a Green Chancellor. Wouldn't it be fair to praise Habeck-Baerbock for refusing to discuss this very scenario and resist with considerable thoughtfulness the temptation of the popularity trend?

P.S. Unlike other groups in the current congregations, it is encouraging that the Greens generally put forward their proposals quite civilised, transparent and democratic. I am grateful to you for giving me the opportunity to make my choice with facts and peace."
"43","NEGATIVE","1, there is no global warming. This invention exists only to make money loose for oculte interests. In other words, no one will know in a few years where the funds for the so-called CO2 pricing have gone. Just as nobody knows why electricity is more expensive in Germany than anywhere in the world.
2. With the green intellectuals (vapour bubbles) - keyword Kobold- there is no point in sketching anything... there is more to teach a monkey to talk.
3. Should Habeck or Baerbock become Chancellor emigrate so many performers that this future green chancellor must invent a ducat donkey. In this case, even the goblins help really little."
"44","NEGATIVE","What is a socio-ecological market economy???
Business student, 5 and put and failed.
Oh, how close to reality!"
"45","NEGATIVE","That is the disadvantage of democracy! A minimum majority come together and perhaps 49% dictates the reconstruction of the until then free and economically successful state. Unfortunately, democracy is not the final end to wisdom either."
"46","NEGATIVE","Heating even more expensive and although it is natural gas? What will this look like in the future? That only one room is heated because you can't afford more? For this, the other rooms would gradually mould, give new diseases, the mold pulls into the building substance and at some point the tenement house becomes unusable. Ergo demolish, tenants either deceased due to the consequences of insufficient money (good for the pension) or but chronically ill (additional costs for the health insurance fund). In addition, there is still a lack of living space because no one wants to build any more in the conditions. For my part, I can only hope that I will bless the temporal at an early stage so that I don't have to experience all the crap anymore."
"47","NEGATIVE","If the Greens enforce all this, I will have to sell my house in 15 years as a pensioner and can't afford a car. And that at 60,000 ocks gross per year. Na great, since you tried to live ecologically meaningful for 30 years and then turn the tap for a little life.
I'm... loud because you're stealing the future!"
"48","NEGATIVE","Oches'? Is this the post-euro currency in Central Europe? 'Coal' would like me better..."
"49","POSITIVE","Baerbock just on TV again. That's where your ears are ringing!"
"50","POSITIVE","Can I only agree!!"
"51","POSITIVE","Who's gonna pay for this? Not only is fuel expensive, but everything else that needs to live like food, heat, mobility and above all electricity.
The pricing of CO2 for electricity and other energy sources is a license to print money and therefore makes everything more expensive because the goods have to be transported. The future Minister of Finance will be pleased.
It just makes the things you need to live very expensive because we can not omit you.
This program makes everyone equally poor except for the Greens, who want to calm their conscience and turn on environmentalists.
Because a minimum wage of 12€is good for me."
"52","NEUTRAL","The German economy wants a CO2 price of 110€and the abolition of eco-tax and EEG levy. The 5 modes of business call for the temporary suspension of the black zero. Social associations call for better social compensation. The Greens meet the demands from different directions and try to bring it together in a concert. No other party is trying to do this, at least at the moment."
"53","NEGATIVE","What is a CO2 price? How is he determined?
What will cost 110 euros? 
What kind of nonsense is that?"
"54","NEGATIVE","I can't understand, at the very best will, who chooses these self-righteous morally superior better-eaters. Debt brake off. For this CO2 control at absurd levels with infinite dynamics. Even on food!!!!! What, please, is it social?"
"55","POSITIVE","Instead of forbidden would be a role model is already a beginning Mr. Habeck and Mrs. Baerbock, train instead of plane, bus instead of company cars, send children to the normal or an inclusive school, instead of to a private school and a windmill in 1 km distance to their home would be great!

Because water preach but wine can really drink, for that we don't need greens! 🤣🤣🤣"
"56","NEGATIVE","I see that too, these Greens can't be chosen"
"57","NEUTRAL","Now the citizen has a duty to ensure that they never come to power."
"58","NEUTRAL","No way, otherwise we can emigrate"
"59","NEGATIVE","This is how it will come: 60€/t CO2 levy, per year 20€ on top of it. And now unwarning, all the money the citizen receives BACK! Rather, the water flows up the mountain before some government returns money that was taken from the citizen once."
"60","NEUTRAL","the sun will rise in the west, and manna will rain from the sky."
"61","NEGATIVE","With socialist experiments on the market economy and all about it wandering around, of dropout students who have not worked productively for a day in their lives, nothing will improve, but will worsen considerably.
Thus it is only deepened division of society."
"62","NEUTRAL","Exemplary of the economic course of the Greens using the example
Minimum wage... 12€. 
That's 1,920 euros at 160 hours a month. Cost for the employer 2,300 euros.

The hairdresser, and that's always the point, is happy, the hairdresser has to pass on the costs.

According to hairdresser's average proceeds for a man's haircut 18€. Net 15€.
For 7customers/day 105€ turnover and 115€ labor costs. Excl. Overheads.

If you take all costs and the income share then the men's haircut would now have to cost 40 to 50€.

So much for the Green Decision €12 minimum wage and what consequences this has for the individual of us."
"63","NEGATIVE","My hairdresser needs only 15 min, makes 30 clients a day times 10€makes 300€per day. Since the price is now much higher, so less will go."
"64","NEUTRAL","This party congress of the Greens shows once again that cuts into individual and entrepreneurial freedom is a main objective of this movement. One wants to come to power in order to impose a way of life on others and thus to curtail the foundations of the free market economy. The best environmental protection is investment in education and car-free infrastructure. If I can safely ride the e-bike on separate cycle routes within 10 km to work through the city, something is won."
"65","POSITIVE","@Tobias Z.

>If I can safely ride the e-bike on separate cycle routes within 10 km to work through the city, something is won. <

Sure, of course. With the suit to work in wind and weather, snow and ice. Divine.

I love it when all the green Smurfs turn out to be absolutely far from reality. And just by the way, what's fine for you doesn't necessarily have to be fine for all the other people who want to work too."
"66","POSITIVE","Very nice especially with the price of animal food will lose some percentage again"
"67","NEGATIVE","a little tip to the green, your approach is wrong.

2011 I moved to sankt pauli, once again burned. no electronic aids more. then I see ne “ancient” bosch washing machine in nem av. this runs until today with me.

turn against disposable products, then you may become credible at some point, even for me."
"68","NEUTRAL","I born 1936 consider the Greens to be a time phenomenon that will later only be used in comics. It's just too much stupid stuff that the world saviors make and represent with faith zeal. Green sustainability is “The main thing we're right and we're fine”
*** My comment from 2016 but still topical ***"
"69","NEGATIVE","The silly thing is that this party is reaching 20% at the moment. Of course, they only come from the SPD, which has burned its voters. Fortunately, there will be few conservatives mutating to the left, unless they completely lose their minds. The problem of the conservatives is Merkel, who has lured the CDU to the left and has driven many conservatives into the AfD, but the cooperation with the latter is taboo. This is also understandable, because otherwise they would make themselves impossible for many remaining voters. However, this disruption rubs the CDU and makes the left gimmicks seem more powerful than they are."
"70","NEGATIVE","It all reminds me of G. Orwell's novels “1984” and “Farm of Animals”...
Social fire hazardous!"
"71","NEGATIVE","What is a good idea for a CO² pricing, when we already pay taxes for all energy? So we're supposed to pay not only for what arrives at us, but also for what comes out? We're already doing that! And the Greens can rename “tax” right away, because nothing else means. And once again, it hits the ordinary citizen, who can't do anything right for them anyway, mostly for purely financial reasons. So this one is further drawn, of course only for ecological reasons... that I don't laugh has the reason that laughter has passed away."
"72","POSITIVE","Very good. Germany must further expand its “world champion status” in terms of the highest taxes and taxes as well as electricity prices. 
Where do we get it when others catch up:)"
"73","NEUTRAL","Do the Greens also know how they want to achieve the social charges, which are likely to increase by a considerable amount until their possible takeover in 2021, if they want to reregulate the mechanisms of the economy? If the engine of the economy is no longer running properly, the tax revenues that keep the system alive are missing."
"74","NEUTRAL","As a preliminary step, electricity providers are raising prices. Then it gets even more expensive in all areas. Public transport will also have to adjust the prices. Suggestion: We stay at home for a week, all day and not just on Friday."
"75","POSITIVE","I'm looking forward to energy money. I then buy myself a scoop of ice, which costs me the energy turnaround every month."
"76","NEGATIVE","Ice cream, it's forbidden. The production process produces too much CO2."
"77","NEGATIVE","Starting in 2030, no longer allowing internal combustion engines means relinquish an important source of income from the CO2 tax. Strange program."
"78","POSITIVE","Wait for rising electricity prices... generating money goes easier as meaningful development."
"79","NEUTRAL","What the hell, here in the country we're gonna be able to stay afloat. I dare doubt whether the main clients of the Greens in the big cities can assert that of themselves, in return. As a proverb says, arrogance comes before the fall, will come true here too. No concept, just rules, prohibitions, education. Who chooses such a thing? Cities are mainly made of concrete and brick, which does not get greener, even with the greens. And nature does not break, here in the countryside we see it every day. For this reason, the Greens don't get a foot under the table here in Thuringia, and that's a good thing."
"80","NEGATIVE","Habeck at the party conference in Bielefeld: “Prohibitions are part of a democracy”. But Mr. Habeck is quite mistaken.
In a democracy, there are laws that are passed by Parliament. This does not include any ideologiscnen bans of parties without democratic legitimacy! What state does Mr. Habeck actually live in?"
"81","NEUTRAL","Mr. Habeck toying with the Chinese surveillance system... that actually says more than a thousand words about him"
"82","NEUTRAL","Hopefully, all the Green voters have noted that their lives will also be priceless."
"83","NEGATIVE","Noted already, but understood?
Admittedly stupid question, mind and choose green? But hello!"
"84","POSITIVE","In view of the green danger, may GroKo last until 2025! I sincerely hope that the Baerbecks will remain in the opposition!"
"85","NEGATIVE","By 2030, no combustion engine means nothing more than to eliminate 600,000 jobs by that time. According to a study by the ifo Institute, so many people work directly on the internal combustion engine. Mostly well-paid jobs. 
They should explain this to a 45 or 50 year old today who is then going to get rid of his job in 10 years at the latest. I believe that dropout or unpitched people do not belong to politics."
"86","NEUTRAL","Why Werner. Why don't you leave her? The 50-year-olds are now retired and young people can see where they stay without work and roof over their heads."
"87","NEUTRAL","The Greens should further sharpen their core competence, environmental protection and ecology, leaving the economy to those who have experience with it. The Greens are following the same path that the CDU has already taken in adopting social issues of the SPD. This preprogrammed interchangeability and arbitrariness. Experience shows that we need political diversity and not inclusion."
"88","NEUTRAL","A minimum wage of 12.- means that all other wage groups want more, as well as that the standard rates for ALG2 and Co will necessarily increase to the same extent, since they are always based on lower wages and not on “demand”. Prices will rise. And again, the minimum wages will be the relatively “poorest”. In addition, however, immigration from Eastern Europe will rise massively because of the increased wage gap, the competitive situation will not improve, because those who work today at the minimum wage will no longer have a job for 12 years, if more qualified applicants move forward."
"89","NEUTRAL","Horst, exactly, and the social security funds are being filled, because that's what the state is clamly."
"90","NEGATIVE","You can't read it and hear it. This green madness stinks to heaven! Neither have these Green solutions nor have the necessary training! We are going to switch to E cars, where the mining of rare earths ravaged whole areas abroad! Who buys an E car is a bigger environmental sinner than someone driving to work with a locomotive."
"91","NEUTRAL","Following today's letter from my energy provider that electricity and gas will cost me about 100 euros a year more, I am completely convinced of the EEG. However, the future CO2 pricing of electricity and gas has not yet been taken into account. Just keep going, we can do it."
"92","NEGATIVE","Anyone who chooses such people/parties should not be surprised if the country is being divided further and further. Prohibitions and patronage are not exactly represented as a mature citizen. M.E. Unselectable."
"93","NEUTRAL","What used to be the socialist paradise is today the ecosocialist. To the smallest planned “market economy”, in German planned economy.If the German want this, then the zenith of prosperity growth is exceeded here, prosperity growth will take place elsewhere (Asia, USA)."
"94","MIXED","I even think some of the measures are good and correct. However, as long as some of the members flirt with Antifa and Communism, the overall concept remains questionable."
"95","NEGATIVE","The Greens have always been so naiv.otherwise you can not call it. They only think they alone can save the world from destruction. If this party is in charge, D. is lost. Unfortunately, it is true that there are still enough people with us who are following this party. Many are blinded by the greens and see only the environmental problems. So this party scores that has slipped so far to the left that they can compete with the left already. 
We will probably become a socialist state. Sometimes I wonder who here is an enemy of democracy and market economy. If the projects are implemented what H&B would imagine, the industry will move in part. Unfortunately, it seems that our government is already taking action by the Greens today."
"96","NEGATIVE","Only if they want to ban or “praise” imports of cheap clothing, plastic sneakers and smartphones from Asia are the Greens and their FFF supporters credible."
"97","MIXED","They can decide on programs at their party congress as they like, and the German media can continue to hype these “prohibition combo” as they like - alone it won't do anything, because these preventers will never get more than 12% of the votes at the federal level in the future! And that's a good thing... if we slip into a recession, drop the dropout to less than 5%..."
"98","NEGATIVE","I'm not so sure. I always experience how people say that environmental protection is so important to them and that only the Greens have the right concept. But when I ask what they attach this to, 99/100 people can't give me any or no good answer. Then they think about 5 minutes and another 30 minutes later they tell the same thing again. In the minds of the people, the image of the Greens is so firmly cemented that borders on a creed. And building on this, I fear that the Greens will continue to strengthen in the future. Facts are of interest to the least, faith alone! And this completely exaggerated climate hysteria does the rest."
"99","NEGATIVE","“The Greens remain in their demands to leave coal by 2030 and not to allow new passenger cars with internal combustion engines from 2030... The CO2 price is intended to increase the cost of fossil fuels, fuel oil and natural gas.”

So everything will become more expensive and you will be forced to use public transport.
From 2030 onwards, the lights in Germany will go out, the economy will migrate, the service providers will flee abroad, and the rest will dwell on the collapsing social system..."
"100","NEGATIVE","For decades, Germany has been painstakingly built up. Our policy will break this in just a few years"
"101","NEGATIVE","“The concept was not spelled out in more detail.” Newspokes intended for not ending. Who should take this seriously and vote?"
"102","NEGATIVE","It would have been a miracle if something else came out to a Green Party Congress, such as meaningful, than even more costs and bans for those who keep the shop running. 
Typical green. 
The numerous, green cuddly items can't change anything."
"103","NEGATIVE","if they had a constructive ecological approach to economic policy.
once again not, but continue prohibition and tax, co2 pricing, ridiculous"
"104","NEUTRAL","Now quickly a job with a salary like a politician, actor, or best-finished so that I can use my vehicle for other purposes other than just to get to work. Let's see if the crowd does so."
"105","NEUTRAL","What's a best-finished man?"
"106","POSITIVE","Born in the GDR and grew up. It has been an environmental disaster in recent years. The Elbe was filled with acid. I have been able to experience a recovery of the environment. Today you can swim in the Elbe. Protecting the environment is a must. We live this as best we can. Regulations must be clear. These should be developed by professionals. Taking into account the aspects of society. Not at a party congress of power-obsessed, work-shy dreamers. A lot of consciousness has also developed from the recent past. No one's talking about that. If green is to become the alternative for life, I'll throw out the garbage again and fire with everything I have. Otherwise, it will be too expensive."
"107","NEGATIVE","From 2030 no new approvals for internal combustion engines. I'm not very confident that over the next decade more than half of the cars will drive electrically. What happens to all the burners after 2030? Well, many are still being used for a few more years, but then? Everybody scrapped? Africa, and the air from the direction is prevented from entering?"
"108","NEGATIVE","As we know for a few days, only the hatred comentaries are blocked and, of course, rightly so 😂😂😂😂. This has nothing to do with criticism of the Greens. 😆"

"110","NEGATIVE","We had one two courtyards.

In the first yard there was hardly any dirt, in the second there was a lot of dirt.

And we always had to return the first farm, because it would be soooo dirty.
So also example for the second court, where you rarely saw a sweep.

This is the case with the Greens: they want to sweep in climate a country that has the best environmental standards in the world, was what good if people in many countries want to walk around with respirators and do not want to take a broom?

Prosperity before climate, so probably almost all people on the globe think, especially the Amen.

Only the Western prosperous countries no longer know where prosperity comes from.

Or, if he's too good cow, she's on the ice.

We need to move the technology forward, but we can't do that with prohibitions, but only with know-how. And know-how develops only in the market economy, not in socialism, as history teaches."

"115","NEGATIVE","God save us from the party! It makes us poor, especially the single AN and pensioner. After all, he will not be able to pay the energy NK for living alone, even other things that are hardly necessary, such as medicines, which, thanks to the CO2 tax, which the Greens demand, are likely to become significantly more expensive! And he won't be able to go anywhere! And public transport is still lagging behind at all corners, and it is not cheap in Germany either. For example, pensioner tariffs were abolished at many bus companies. But I really care the most about living! Unchanged an annual increase in rental prices of about 5%, and now the insane eco-tax, which makes heating priceless, which as a tenant you can hardly avoid, because you can't choose your heating system! And the electricity? He won't get cheaper, on the contrary, just got 5 -10% more expensive, just got the info, + 8%, green electricity mind you! I or hardly anyone will get that much salary or pension increase! Since use 100€backflow/J little,! And those who have a lot of money won't change their behavior! Poor becomes poorer ff."

"118","NEUTRAL","Who would have thought that the Greens of all people is once the only party in Germany that has thoughtful and reasonable concepts, while from all other parties either nothing at all, meaningless stammel, rumgedoktere without any plan, populism, voters... lberung and and and and come (list could be as long as you like) )."

"120","POSITIVE","I grew up in the Ruhr region of the 60s and 70s and I am therefore very aware of the importance of environmental protection for our lives and our survival. And now it is about preserving resources and the opportunities of future generations. In this respect, like the Greens, I see a great need to protect our environment and our resources. In my opinion, questionable is just the right way. The Greens pursue a policy that leads us into a state economy and pushes back or partially abolishes the market. This hasn't gone well yet. Ways must be found that do not harm our economy and can do as far as possible without conductivism. This is a difficult challenge."
"121","NEUTRAL","So the following applies: green politics must be able to afford. Other industrialized nations would lick their fingers to take the German place, we would then be a global eco-pioneer with a barely administered rule popancy that significantly weakens the location, puts even more strain on the working population and helps the global climate marginally. But we feel good, that counts!

In addition to the ecosocial decline, was something decided? Maybe what on the topic of securing the pension? Internal security? Immigration? Medical care? Infrastructure? Education? In addition to the provision of what our prosperity should look like in the future, is rather irrelevant, but one will be allowed to ask."
"122","NEUTRAL","In my view, the rural population is the focus of the GREEN first. The price of agricultural products, of course taxes on heating systems, because of homes, and the imminent reduction of mobility. I cannot understand why so little rural people choose progressive greens. But saving is compulsory in the country."
"123","NEUTRAL","More taxes on CO2? No problem, only ruins crafts, construction, small and medium-sized enterprises. Expenses massive housing and transportation. Class idea to want to “save” the environment with more taxes.
And when all their heat pumps and charging stations start up in winter, it's all without coal, gas and nuclear power."
"124","NEUTRAL","The Greens are the only party that still has an idea of an evolution of economy, economy and responsibility.
It is right that animal welfare needs to be strengthened and strengthened.
It is true that the economy also bears responsibility for the pollution of the planet.
It is true that binding rules and not freedom of rule will bring a society forward.
We are one of the last countries where you can race like wild on motorways instead of implementing a reasonable speed limit that avoids accidents and protects the environment.

Does the CDU take care of consumer protection?
Or best the FDP?
What does environmental protection look like under a CDU/FDP government?
Under a CDU/FDP government, in the absence of European rules, cages and minimum standards for animal rights would still exist.

If most people here want exactly that, then society is cold and little worth living."
"125","NEGATIVE","So, shut down power plants without knowing how to replace them, collect the citizen with the CO2 price, it doesn't really believe anyone in a repayment that forces people to take an electric car, stop eating meat, etc. Saving the landscape with the useless wind turbines in silence. All of this, of course, without a measurable climate effect.
I'd have to be powdered with the staple bag if I chose them."
"126","NEUTRAL","It is a general consensus that it cannot continue as it is at present. The Greens dare to go ahead with an alternative. It's better than just a “keep it up”."
"127","NEGATIVE","The only alternative is to stop and reverse the constant inflow into social systems, because they were never meant to do so.

"128","NEUTRAL","I believe that some of the Greens are simply contempt for human beings.

"129","NEGATIVE","“The Greens remain in their demands to exit coal by 2030 and not to allow new passenger cars with internal combustion engines from 2030” 
Then where will the electric power come from?
 Germany produced 40% regenerative energy in 2018, but only 22% could be fed in! 20% of the production came from wind! An exit from coal and nuclear energy by 2030 would have to be compensated by a tripling of the generation from wind and the realization of the storage capacity. In 2019, the expansion almost came to a standstill. There are no locations for wind turbines, because the minimum distance of 1000 m from the residential development will not be undermined. there is no need to expand the networks. We will or will we have to pay for the conversion? These utopias are overwhelming society.
No cars with internal combustion engines should be registered from 2030? Probably, so that there is enough diesel for the further expanding truck traffic and the cars on the highways do not interfere with freight traffic! Another utopia that overwhelmed everyone!"

The Greens are calling for a social and ecological transformation of the market economy. (*1)

*1: Listening to the Greens is really fun.

But what is an ecosocial market economy?

Points:
-the debt brake for the federal government can be loosened under EU rules so that the state can invest significantly more than before.

-raise the minimum wage from currently €9.19 to €12

-reform the (minimum wage) commission

quota for the use of recycled material.

-to get out of the coal by 2030

-No new passenger cars with internal combustion engines from 2030.

CO2 price: In 2020, it is expected to be €60 per tonne and increase in increments of €20 per year.

Question: Does the ecosocial market economy work in a similar way to fixed feed-in tariffs for wind and solar power? = EEG levies = Even such an invention by the Greens and now gives the consumer pay-slave a KW price of 0.30 cents. Uniquely expensive in comparison worldwide.

Or does it work as with the “eco-tax” on all petroleum products = has been levied since 1999 and seeps into the federal budget.

Or it works like the “Green Point” (yellow bag of plastic waste) from 1995, which ends up in waste incineration plants (high calorific value) or in Indonesian landfills (how does the stuff from Germany actually get there?).

The Green Dot and the eco-tax from the 1990s ultimately led to an increase in consumer prices and did not lead to a reduction in raw materials, CO2, or anything else. It all became more expensive and a few people made a good deal under the exploitation of consumers. 

Only the deposit return system works quite neatly, but it is not an invention of the Greens, but was imported from the USA. It secures the bottle collectors a small extra money."
"131","POSITIVE","One success story after another. Thanks for the summary."
"132","NEGATIVE","Greens can decide a lot. Until the next BT election a lot of water flows down the Rhine and then no one is interested in the rules of the greens, who have lost sight of being environmentally friendly. Now you prefer to be left and enjoy useless demands such as speed limits on motorways."
"133","NEGATIVE","Speed limits are so absurd that almost all countries of the world have introduced one. But bans are also bad. Again and again I am annoyed that it is forbidden to throw your garbage into the forest, smoke in the cinema, walk over the traffic lights at red and now very much about the fact that it is forbidden to offend your fellow human beings evil; -)"
"134","NEUTRAL","If the debt brake is loosened, Germany can finally alike with other EU countries, make strong debts until the country is broke, then uncontrolled immigration will regulate itself."
"135","NEGATIVE","Every new tax cups the middle class and is abused for the mild donation of the highly revered politicians. Like the indulgences trade to build St. Peter's Basilica. Politicians have always thought about the people."
"136","NEUTRAL","Not chosen to determine nothing."
"137","NEUTRAL","The concepts developed and implemented by the Party the Greens starting from the Green Point to the EEG levies are and were a system where many burdens are being burdened and that does not bring too little and only a few things. At the Green Point, the waste is either incinerated or transferred abroad and relatively little recycled, while the EEG levies pay millions for electricity that is not produced. If an ecological economy system is installed according to the Green Ideas and it runs like the Green Point or the EEG levies then Germany is a 4th world country."
"138","NEUTRAL","If the GREEN succeed in co-governing after the next Bundestag election, it will be very, very expensive for the citizen in the Federal Republic of Germany!"
"139","NEGATIVE","Germany will probably risk its competitiveness and make itself a mockery of the planet. Food and drink, as well as a roof over your head are not so important. The main thing is that conscience is pure and we save the world."
"140","NEUTRAL","Quote. “All revenues from the CO2 price, which is supposed to be a supplement to the energy tax, want the Greens to return directly to the citizens as “energy money”.”
If you want to pass on all CO2 receipts to the citizens, it is a zero-sum game for the state, because then everyone could see the increased costs of the so-called “energy money”
, only the VAT is not taken into account.

Or maybe a “energy money” means test in between
must be switched on. But that will certainly give a compromise as with the basic duck,
Mileage rate, etc.

I guess the devil is back in the detail."
"141","NEUTRAL","No, people in the country pay the tickets for the green women in Berlin. Therefore, the wind blows"
"142","NEGATIVE","I guess I can't be. Why does politicians want their failures to be reimbursed by the taxpayer over and over again? If you screw up, you send the customer an extra bill. For the microplastic in the ground, a barrel will be opened at some point. These are strange, even simple and comfortable knitted methods, which in particular do not solve the causal problem in any way."
