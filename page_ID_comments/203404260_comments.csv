"1","POSITIVE","This pleasantly factual representation of the constitutional context is one more reason for my WORLD subscription."
"2","NEUTRAL","What does the ‚ÄúW‚Äù mean in the top right corner of the comment? Thanks"
"3","NEUTRAL","This is what it looks like, the AFD's position on factual issues..."
"4","NEUTRAL","I've known the SPD for decades. I know Mr. BK Schmid, Mr. Bk Schr√∂der and predecessor. There are no successors today. I don't like to see anyone from this leadership at the top of the political leadership. Gruesome"
"5","NEGATIVE","Is Mr. Kahrs not the one who harassed and staked one or more women???
What does he open his M.?"
"6","NEUTRAL","As far as I know, Mr. Kahrs only recently married a man.
So I don't think so..."
"7","NEUTRAL","How does the man imagine that? It is a democratically elected party."
"8","NEUTRAL","From which wood Mr. Kahrs is carved you can read here. 
https://www.zeit.de/2005/47/Telefonterror"
"9","POSITIVE","Kahrs is, because of his super way of evaluating everything real and being able to behave great criticism. I really appreciate him."
"10","NEGATIVE","How could it be that none of my posts will be published? I have only mentioned with the most polite notes that Mr Kahr wants to dispose of Mrs Merkel. I did not mention the terror calls (getting rightful punishment made at night) against his party mate."
"11","NEGATIVE","The fact that Kahrs is crazy is understandable, the subject is already absurd. What's the next interview? If we want to ban the winter, you can only stand badly."
"12","NEGATIVE","Since the dismissal of masses, one cannot escape the impression that the protection of the Constitution has already been politically motivated. It's bad about democracy."
"13","NEUTRAL","A sentence in the article puts it to the point: 
‚ÄúThe constitutional protection employees gather the insights that the politicians then evaluate. Those who confuse this sequence are putting pressure on the authorities.‚Äù

I see this order confused under Haldenwang. Maassen's successor Haldenwang immediately responded to the widespread desire of our parliamentarians to observe the political competition from the right of the constitutional protection. Although the ‚Äúsuspected case‚Äù was limited to the right-wing ‚Äúwing‚Äù around H√∂cke and the youth organization of the AFD, this measure achieved the public effect that the political competition parties wanted to achieve.
In my view, Haldenwang has been used here. Neutrality and professional distance I can't see at Haldenwang. 

The overwhelming of political parties vis-√†-vis authorities with a view to political influence on government decisions must be resolutely opposed. In fact, the above arthicle of the world fulfills the task of the ‚ÄúFourth Violence‚Äù in the State. It is gratifying that this control function has been increasingly taking place recently and politicians such as Kahrs are being put into democratic barriers."
"14","NEGATIVE","Everyone can have their own opinion on the AFD. What Kahrs tried and would like is, of course, strong tobak. His own party has crashed unprecedented because it obviously no longer represents the voters, i.e. the sovereign. To slow down this path into possible insignificance by possible prohibitions on competitors is completely wrong and profoundly undemocratic.
Why doesn't he just try the better arguments and activities?"
"15","NEUTRAL","In recent years, in the SPD, they have already gladly tried internally with prohibitions when they ran out of arguments in the discussion.
It remains to be hoped that the voters are now faster and will send this party to dissolution. Your time is up."
"16","POSITIVE","The greatest critics of the moose are basically themselves."
"17","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúHowever, it cannot be the purpose of journalism to repeat a conversation so often until the interviewee can present his position without contradiction and does not have to restrict or revoke his Twitter statements.‚Äù

Correct, that's how it must be!"
"18","NEGATIVE","The overwhelming wave of discrediting and contempt of AFD voters on the part of all other parties, the churches, and even the Federal Chancellor, is contrary to the hatred speeches of the AFD, which are rightly criticised. They call AFD voters despicable, as if they had the plague. In doing so, they are disappointed voters of the traditional parties and basically only criticize."
"19","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúThe constitutional protection offices of the Federal Government and the L√§nder are still examining the party's loyalty to constitutions. Since the beginning of the year, the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection under the leadership of Thomas Haldenwang has been targeting the youth organization of the party and the so-called wing around the Thuringian AFD leader Bj√∂rn H√∂cke as a ‚Äúsuspicious case‚Äù. However, according to information from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, ‚Äúthe threshold for suspicion‚Äù is currently not reached for the party as a whole. ‚Äú


There is now the very informative and informative press conference of the AfD with Prof. Dr. Murswiek, who presents his report commissioned by the AfD.

Highly recommended. People like Kahrs and Haldenwang really scares me."
"20","NEGATIVE","so much on the subject:
we will stop the AFD with arguments..........."
"21","NEUTRAL","I remember well how various politicians from the other parties have generously announced that they would put the AfD in terms of content. I'll wait for it until today.
After that obviously did not work out, one tries it with a prohibition procedure - without obviously being aware of the legitimate high hurdles of such a procedure.
Or stop - perhaps you are aware of the hurdles, then it's just obvious cheap populism, that is, what the same people like to blame for the AfD.

Somehow I've experienced all this before, back then in connection with the PDS. It goes without saying that today coalises with them."
"22","NEUTRAL","The demand of interviewees to reread what has been said once in writing and, if necessary, to shorten, correct and supplement what has been said, depending on the mood situation, is an immorality which is mainly practiced in Germany, although the press law does not know any compulsion to do so. In this respect, it would be very interesting to know what Mr Kahrs said, which he no longer wants to stand on."
"23","NEGATIVE","I find it very commendable that this embarrassing process is mentioned in the first place, because one likes to drop something like that under the table. The fact that our elitist politicians are just shouting out words is nothing new."
"24","NEUTRAL","In his appearance, Kahrs works the way left imagine a typical AfD politician..."
"25","NEUTRAL","Oh, that was my first thought, too."
"26","POSITIVE","It is always interesting to read that the old politicians believe the AFD is responsible for the devastating of society. It is precisely these parties who have been governing the country for decades and have shaped society since then. I don't think that the influence of a party that has only existed for a few years is so great. Of course, people have always been there, only previously active in other parties. To demonize the AFD in this way will not work long to keep the AFD small. If the discontent among the people becomes large enough, the party will grow accordingly.

Dealing with the AFD is a joke. This is because in reality the other parties did not respond either. And that is why we are increasingly using this ‚Äúright-wing‚Äù to attack the political opponents."
"27","NEGATIVE","So I looked at some Bundestag debates after the AFD moved in there and I have to tell them that the AFD has tightened the tone of conversation there, sometimes already pulled into a ridiculous one, everyone could have given it. 
However, the fact that the other parties have entered this clumsy way does not bear witness to a great culture of debate either.
And I wonder, the AFD has done something about being pushed into the right corner, no, you haven't distanced yourself, or I'm wrong.

Last but not least, I am opposed to a ban unless clearly the support of anti-national groups is proven, also applies to links, so some politicians should simply be calm."
"28","POSITIVE","Thank you, worth reading."
"29","NEUTRAL","The Bremen Johannes Kahrs. What else can you say..."
"30","NEUTRAL","Isn't he from Hamburg?"
"31","NEUTRAL","Should the AFD succeed in forbidding (or equivalent another, unpleasant, party), the ‚Äúthought‚Äù is far from gone. I see it this way: the more vehemently you take action against an extremist side, the stronger it will defend itself. And if that is so, then there is a possibility that it will be very uncomfortable, resp. could become. You can't keep a side ‚Äúunder pressure‚Äù forever without it resist..."
"32","NEGATIVE","I don't think the AfD doesn't fight back at all. There would be even more, even by way of legal action"
"33","NEGATIVE","It's all fraud on the voter. If AfD is elected by the voter, it should also rule üëç"
"34","POSITIVE","@ WORLD:

Thank you very much! That's what I mean by independent quality journalism. 

My highest resept!"
"35","POSITIVE","Thank you for this article. There should be more of this if politicians do not dare to defend their positions against critical issues, journalism must put their finger in the wound.
But: ‚ÄúDon't you even strengthen the AfD with prohibition discussions?‚Äù that consideration should not be part of a constitutional state. If a party poses a threat to the FDGO, it must be banned, the rule of law works. Nor would anyone have the idea to grant criminal gangs because other gangs are even more criminal."
"36","NEGATIVE","I think so. If a party really wants to abolish our liberal democratic order, it must be banned. Only, that's not the case with the AfD."
"37","NEUTRAL","To sharpen the terms, I give here literally a nationwide DPA message from the
31 July 1993, which I found in the CN and NEZ here in the district of Cuxhaven:

‚ÄúWon't listen
Munich (Reuter) A follow-up
monitoring of the service would be
the right-wing radical Republicans
in the opinion of the Bavarian
Administrative Court against the
whose parties are unlawfully aware of the
partial. In this way, the
to be recently published on Friday-
spoken ban on monitoring
by the protection of the Constitution.‚Äù"
"38","NEUTRAL","If they are already coming to such thoughts, then one can be curious to see what else can come up with when things are going economically downhill in the country for a long time. When voter concerns rise massively and many more voters consider not to make their cross where the fathers have already done. 
Living abroad, I saw in 2008 how tensions in all areas of society increase when massive economic problems arise. And just how the established parties get under pressure and completely new parties storm the 20% in just a few years."
"39","NEGATIVE","The AFD succeeds in giving unaccustomed impetus to the harmonious, social relaxation policy, and disappointed voters also vote for it. Since the arguments of the AFD and the voters cannot be resolved, a party ban is the obvious solution. However, one ignores the fact that the AFD voters vote the AFD not because of Mr H√∂cke, but despite Mr H√∂cke in order to express displeasure about the current policy. As long as politicians do not approach voters, this will certainly not change."
"40","POSITIVE","Thank you G√ºnther! That's what it looks like. Well summarized."
"41","POSITIVE","It's amazing what fears have now developed against the AfD. Remember the advent of the Pirate Party. What were knitted there for scenarios. Meanwhile, peace has come back, as there is no danger in this party anymore. Fresstr√∂ge filled with taxpayed-financed jobs are secured. At least against the opponent pirate party. Seems different with the AfD, otherwise the screaming wouldn't be so big."
"42","POSITIVE","Thank you for this clever and skillfully exposing article."
"43","NEGATIVE","‚ÄúApparently dissatisfied with the course of the discussion, the member of the Bundestag broke the interview ahead of schedule. His office later announced that it did not want to release the quotes.‚Äù
The big problem of the German political landscape. No politician has the guts to ask himself an unpleasant question. Instead, the morality has crept in to release interviews.
At least you write that Kahrs didn't want to publish. We need much more of this in Germany. If a politician is too lash to ask difficult questions, the media should calmly say where the rabbit is in the pepper.
Why, as a voter, should I choose someone who doesn't dare to give interviews."
"44","NEUTRAL","As indicated in the article, one must clearly distinguish between the protection of the Constitution and the Federal Constitutional Court. If constitutional judges were put under political pressure, or if the Constitutional Court were to prohibit the AfD under ‚Äúperceived law‚Äù, our entire constitutional state would be worth nothing more with a single slash fa√ßade, waste! For these reasons, we are witnessing that the cry against the AfD is huge, but no one wants to put a ban on it. It is not even sure for me whether the ‚Äúwing‚Äù would be banned for itself (if that could be isolated). Because what I know from H√∂cke & Co. from the media is folklorized chatter, that's all. I am not aware that H√∂cke threatens anyone or preaches violence or wants to abolish democracy. The fact that the H√∂ckesche political style is morally repulsive in view of our history is probably not enough to be able to ban the ‚Äú(AfD) wing‚Äù in conformity with the Constitution. The political centre should therefore rather make a better policy (EU policy, migration policy...), then the AfD would shrink again. To insult the voters in Thuringia is guaranteed to be the wrong way."
"45","POSITIVE","Very well stated. The AfD is rightly criticized for many things, be it the lack of legal distinction or for extreme right-wing failures in its own ranks. 
But to squadron about a ban on the AfD, as not only Kahrs does, this threatens our rule of law and our democracy more than the AfD itself! There will be no way by the other parties to learn to deal with this new force. This work will not be detriment from them either the constitutional protection or a court."
"46","POSITIVE","Project < 5%, in progress. It's going well."
"47","NEUTRAL","How about analyzing the anti-constitutional nature of governments over the last 18 years. After all, the Federal Constitutional Court has legally established that the massive cuts in the financial contributions of Harz 4 amounting to 60 to 100% are contrary to the constitutional law. Would the entire government not have to be monitored by the protection of the Constitution and, if necessary, banning it?
And why did it take so many years (decades) before such a serious breach of law was revealed?
The next Bundestag election will show what opinion the people have about politicians and parties who are trampling the Basic Law!"
"48","NEGATIVE","Laws have been collected from the Federal Constitutional Court over and over again. This is a clapping slap for the members of the Bundestag. Sometimes I think these employees sat laws according to the motto ‚ÄúLet's try it once‚Äù. It's good sat we have a federal constitutional law. We also had federal presidents who rightly refused the necessary signature. But these critical people are quickly getting rid of in our country."
"49","NEGATIVE","Was Kahrs not the one who accused an entire parliamentary group in the House as ‚Äúugly‚Äù with all sorts of other gross insinuations?
I really don't know whose language is more common. He can certainly compete with a Brandner."
"50","NEGATIVE","I wonder why Mr Kahrs is referred to as a budgetary politician here. I always thought he was busy with disposal policy. He wanted to dispose of certain people.

For me, it's the classic case of a person sitting in the glasshouse throwing stones. I can do without such type."
"51","NEGATIVE","Probably the dream of every politician: simply lock away the critics. In other words (and not from me): if you can't change the message, you just have to silently the messenger."
"52","NEUTRAL","That is why one yearns for socialist conditions, because then one can fulfill these dreams and desires."
"53","POSITIVE","My assessment of my neighbor Johannes Kahrs is fully confirmed by this article. It's always fun when he performs himself as the SPD speaker again."
"54","POSITIVE","@ R√ºdiger
My heartfelt condolences for such a neighborhood."
"55","NEGATIVE","The only thing Mr. Kahrs has achieved with his idea is that many are looking at his Wikipedia entry and also what is written about him on the net, for example at Zeit-Online. And this is not particularly flattering. I cannot say that he has launched a wave of approval for his prohibition idea within the Bundestag. Looks like a classic pipe crap to me, Colonel of the Reserve."
"56","NEGATIVE","For such a colonel in the reserve, the Bundeswehr can confidently stand in the corner and be a bit ashamed. üò°"
"57","NEGATIVE","Banned because unconstitutional, SRP and KPD were.
The parties DKP and NPD have not been unconstitutional, but have been legally established that they are ‚Äúconstitutional‚Äù parties. This has serious consequences for those civil servants who, despite written warning, continued their candidacy for these parties.
But let me teach you."
"58","NEGATIVE","How desperate you have to be as a half-way intelligent person..?!"
"59","POSITIVE","‚Äúhalfway‚Äù. That was good!"
"60","NEGATIVE","Kahrs is one of the most unpleasant representatives of the SPD, insubstantial, always too loud, one to whom it seems most important to profile yourself."
"61","NEGATIVE","What does Mr Kahrs intend to do with his impossible, out of control and somehow pubertal statements on Twitter and in speeches in the Bundestag? Now this interview. He must have a problem controlling himself. There is no other way to explain. He also knows that even more openly anti-constitutional elements are found among the Greens and the Left than with the AFD. I am thinking of SKA Keller and MEP Martina Renner who openly advertise the Antifa. Imagine an AFD politician standing on the lectern with an IB sticker."
"62","NEUTRAL","As far as I know, the IB has not yet burned cars, attacked police officers or committed other crimes"
"63","NEGATIVE","Sure, they want to ban anyone who has a different opinion. However, they have no arguments for this and so they rely on their useful left-wing idiots: see University of Hamburg, Universot√§t G√∂ttingen,..."
"64","POSITIVE","I repeat myself, but the behaviour of the SPD, the Greens and the Left over the last decades has been the best illustration lesson for the new right."
"65","NEGATIVE","An example of total overhaul of underpaid representatives. I'm glad at least the basic pension comes."
"66","NEUTRAL","The great (T9 Tote:D) ‚ÄúPeople's Party‚Äù SPD strikes around itself in the battle of death.

Either they cut off the entire party leadership and ALL MEPs, or they fall behind the FDP. Only a total operation can help there. If possible, no more professional politicians, 7 years per office as with mayors should be enough."
"67","NEGATIVE","The man is a single embarrassment in his speeches and disparsations in the Bundestag."
"68","NEGATIVE","Weak idea of Kahrs! 

To me, he's one of the potters in the SPD. Harm it more than he uses it. Harm the SPD more than it uses it. But maybe the AfD uses more than it hurts her."
"69","NEUTRAL","Johannes Kahrs... is next to Stegner the most extreme left in the SPD! 
For these ‚Äúpoliticians‚Äù, the AFD is the deadly enemy

 what am I glad that all of these will soon be part of German history."
"70","NEUTRAL","@ Kunta K.
Sorry, but Mr. Kahrs is one of the spokespersons of the Seeheimer Kreis, the right wing of the SPD. Was in the Bundeswehr, is Colonel of the Reserve and was in a connection while studying. If someone does not belong to the extreme left of the SPD, it is Johannes Kahrs. I have not quite understood why Mr Kahrs is raising the subject of AfD more than the rest of his group (ban). I think he likes to make a lot of wind. He is not quite indisputable in the Hamburg SPD."
"71","NEUTRAL","Thank you for publishing this process, in which Mr Kahrs obviously only wants to make himself interesting.
Is it possible to call what Mr Kahrs is doing populism?"
"72","POSITIVE","Glad that the world publishes this.

H√∂cke cancels interview: big wave in the press apparatus.
Kahr cancels interview: except for the world and some xxx24 news instantaneous water heaters nobody cares."
"73","NEGATIVE","While reading the article, I wondered if Mr Jahr is on the ground of the democratic basic order. Wanting to ban a party just because my opinion does not suit me testifies to a lack of understanding of democracy. An essential point is freedom of expression. This applies not only to my position. Democracy includes factual discussion with and within the parties and opinions. Exclusion, speaking and working bans are undemocratic and poison the political climate."
"74","NEGATIVE","If you want to know what kind of person is calling for the ban on a group that is unpleasing to him: just google the name.
My hair is up to me, by whom we are ‚Äúrepresented‚Äù and by what methods he has used to fight for his position of power. 
His voting behaviour can also be seen on 'Members' Watch. His local party association is said to have received donations from the arms industry.
The CV alone (little qualification, but criminal law trials for the threat of the political corader) causes me horror."
"75","POSITIVE","This is what the CV of many so-called politicians in Berlin looks like 

The AFD has the highest proportion of academics

if you look at the vitas of the Greens and the Left, there is almost nothing at all.. since you probably have to sing and scream mainly good"
"76","NEUTRAL","It is worrying how attempts are being made to place the AfD in the National Socialist corner, only so that they could be banning it. Not that there is one or the other member of the AfD with sometimes criticised statements. However, this is no different in all other parties.
The only parties that have recently violated the liberal democratic basic order and laws based on it are the Union and the SPD at Dublin II and the no-bailout rule in the eurozone. As far as Kahrs is concerned, this reminds me of the impeachment attempts by the Democrats against Trump in the US."
"77","POSITIVE","Very nice article, Mrs Breyton. That's how journalism should be! Thanks"
"78","NEGATIVE","If you take Mr Jahr's statements to the standard, then you can only come to the verdict that he is a populist in pure culture.
He tears up topics in the market and when it comes to the implementation, he shrugs his shoulders and pulls back into the pouting corner"
"79","NEUTRAL","(Edit) Of course Mr. Kahrs (*,, ,‚Äî* Autocorrection)"
"80","NEGATIVE","What has such a mob, insult and telephone terrorist (against a political competitor - criminally judged) like Kahrs to look for in the Bundestag?"
"81","NEUTRAL","You'll have to do some research in his constituency. Strange what encourages some people to choose such pseudopolitics."
"82","NEGATIVE","First, the SPD should ban the Kahrs! He is harming his party and the AfD is allowed to rub his hands thanks to his arrogant dumb."
"83","NEUTRAL","In fact, all established parties provide the intellectual basis for a mentality that can be seen in Mr Kahrs. Statements after elections such as ‚ÄúWe speak to all democratic parties‚Äù regarding a possible coalition, imply that millions of AfD voters have opted for a party outside the democratic spectrum.
Here it was worthwhile to insist stubbornly in order to expose these meanwhile accepted statements in our democracy as what they are, namely testimonies of a democratic basic attitude of the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù parties."
"84","NEUTRAL","‚Äúto expose these statements, which have now been taken for granted in our democracy as what they are, namely testimonies of a democratic attitude of the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù parties.‚Äù

Exactly!"
"85","NEUTRAL","Especially the policy of the SPD, of course the other established parties, has made an AfD possible. Holding on to these positions has brought the SPD almost to a level with the FDP. If there is no AfD, there will be a successor party. Only if the voters succeed in retracting the voters through a changed policy will there be no need for an AfD ban. If this does not succeed, then there will be a policy determined by the AfD in Germany."
"86","NEGATIVE","Well, is it a pity if the voter comes to others, of course the wrong ones, conclusions than he may? Then the rod is pulled and it is called ‚ÄúBack in the limb, zackzack - and once again detention at the Democracy School. And until the opinion is correct‚Äù."
"87","POSITIVE","With this action, Mr Kahrs has particularly benefited from the AfD. He behaves so amateurically that one could believe that he himself is a member of this very party."
"88","NEUTRAL","How do you think Kahrs might give the impression he might be a member of the AFD? I am not aware that the AFD is demanding any prohibition demands from other democratically legitimized parties."
"89","NEGATIVE","I am horrified that such low spirits govern our country, as long as parties are available to vote on electoral certificates, one must also refrain from changing majority relations. I also have to deal with a left (formerly PDS, formerly SED), or with a KPD or an MLPD. But the last two are unimportant in the structure of power, just like an NPD. Only the AfD is confusing a lot, but that's how it is in Germany, everything that gets too strong is trying to ban. We are fully on the road to socialism. In Thuringia, a petition against the AfD is in progress, one calls for the exclusion of this party, but refers to the idea of freedom and democracy, I'm sorry that everything has nothing to do with democracy anymore. It makes no sense to have such discussions at all, but everyone sticks only to his armchair, at the moment no proper policy is being made. At the moment, the people only have the impression that everything is out of control. Thank you World for having the courage to write this article."
"90","NEUTRAL","Let us look at the facts from the very foundations. Why has the AfD become so strong? If you look at survey history, you can see that these rose sharply with the refugee crisis in 2015.
Since then, the federal level has been around 12 -15%.
Called refugee crisis was triggered by whom? Right, from the government. Who's involved? Right, the SPD of Mr. Kahrs.
So now, through my own failure or even worse, my own will, I have causalized something that I can't get rid of now.
So please let others make sure that the ghosts I called disappear again. 
Honestly, I do not know how far such thought bearers, who, incidentally, also attack democratically elected parties to Parliament, are politically acceptable. What is now happening in political circus is all honour to its name!"
"91","NEGATIVE","They don't want to get rid of the ghosts, they called them, because they call them on and out loud. They just want to hide the disastrous consequences that this has. This is also meant by the electoral slap: ‚ÄúWe have not managed to make the citizen feel that our policies were good.‚Äù

Reality doesn't matter, only representation. That's irresponsible."
"92","NEGATIVE","Kahrs, the small, left, needy hamster cheek, makes on thick pants, was once with the Bundeswehr, ridiculous figure, but has the mission to govern us!!!"
"93","MIXED","Good and balanced handling of the process by Mrs Breyton. Mr Kahr's contentions are obviously lacking in substance. Too much self-performance by Mr. K."
"94","NEGATIVE","It is amazing how amateur Mr Kahrs has handled the matter. He couldn't have made himself look worse."
"95","NEUTRAL","I wonder how to protect the SPD from its own politician."
"96","NEUTRAL","Can you take the SPD seriously???"
"97","NEUTRAL","I always thought interlectual poverty existed only in the extreme parties."
"98","NEUTRAL","Well, the SPD has mutated into an extremist party under Kahrs, Stegner, K√ºhnert etc."
"99","NEUTRAL","Huh, get out of here, quick...
Mr. Kahrs: ‚ÄúIf you have no idea, just...‚Äù"
"100","NEGATIVE","The fact that people want to decide on jobs based on party membership is more than monstrous. This is unconstitutional!"
"101","NEGATIVE","A lawyer who gives such a thing, unbelievable... the citizen is lucky that he is not working as such. Well, lawyer, he studied law for nine years and passed the first state examination. This is not enough for the position of a judge or for admission as a lawyer..."
"102","NEGATIVE","He's not a lawyer, he wanted to be a...
In principle, he is jobless.. :"
"103","NEGATIVE","So, I am appalled how openly one can now publish anti-constitutional statements on Twitter without being reviewed by the protection of the Constitution."
"104","NEUTRAL","Examples? Or do you even mean yourself Mr. ‚ÄúDr.‚Äù"
"105","NEUTRAL","With these sympathy carriers such as Kahrs and Stegner, the path for the SPD to insignificance is marked."
"106","NEUTRAL","Yes, dear Mr. Kahrs... he seems to have latently set the size goal of the limit below his party!? I'm curious to see when the party newspaper will be renamed ‚ÄúDown‚Äù..."
"107","NEUTRAL","And after that, the FDP is banned. Their neoliberal views are ultimately incompatible with human dignity."
"108","NEUTRAL","What Mr. Kahrs calls for is GDR 2.0, because the ‚Äúright‚Äù party affiliation largely decided on the professional career.
According to M. M., in the interest of the SPD, he should restrain his complacency..."
"109","NEGATIVE","Well, we're supposed to be on the way to socialism. Now we are pleased that the wall is gone and the next day we continue to become less liberal bit by bit.
That's all overrated!"
"110","NEGATIVE","It paves the way below the 5%. Such undemocratic politicians do not need a people."
"111","POSITIVE","That would be a dream!"
"112","NEGATIVE","This Mr. Kars has a strange understanding of democracy. Anyone who does not follow their own opinion simply forbid... Where did we last have such a policy on German soil? Right in the GDR wrongfully state... One could rightly ask the question whether the SPD is not much more likely to be a case for the VS in the face of such demands of individual members... (Irony!)
Incompetent, loud and unsympathetic. I thought these attributes mostly apply to Ralf Stegner at the SPD... He seems to have got a branch in Kars. To what extent such a mobbious and dubious behaviour to stabilize the SPD is, can be seen from the weekly decreasing survey values."
"113","NEUTRAL","Stegner and Kahrs - wouldn't that be the ideal duo for the SPD party presidency?"
"114","NEUTRAL","That is why Mrs Merkel can also give all questions in writing before an interview. And woe, you ask out of the line."
"115","NEGATIVE","That sounds like he wants to use the methods of Mr. E. from the T. here. This country must be protected from this."
"116","NEGATIVE","Well, hardly do journalists make that what distinguishes journalists, namely critically questioning a politician, without political prejudice, comes out that he only seeks attention, but has neither thought nor done the necessary detailed work. Yes, Groko."
"117","NEUTRAL","When dealing with the Constitution in this way, Mr Kahrs should be reviewed."
"118","NEUTRAL","This kind of understanding of democracy, as Mr Kahrs has shown, will by no means stop the downward trend of the SPD, but will accelerate further."
"119","POSITIVE","And that's good."
"120","NEGATIVE","Mr Kahrs wants to deprive ordinary AFD members of civil servants. This is extreme left-wing and extremely unconstitutional, unbelievable I am not an official nor an AFD member."
"121","NEUTRAL","Some in the SPD seem to have a particularly good command of pushing their party towards insignificance."
"122","NEGATIVE","‚ÄúIt is necessary to say clearly that the AfD is responsible for this decay.‚Äù

Unbelievable that the established parties still do not understand that they themselves are cause. With a sensible policy for the people, the AfD would never have received so many votes. It's easier to find guilt on others than to sweep in front of your own door"
"123","NEUTRAL","They speak from my soul, when all parties are far in the left half, Sue don't have to be surprised when new ones are positioned in the centre/right. If the SPD would be where it used to be and the CDU/CSU where it was, the AfD would have to fight with the 5% limit"
"124","NEUTRAL","Kahrs has a lot of opinion with so few percent of votes. The former grands of the party, such as Brand, Wehner and Schmidt, would be ashamed to find such an incapable state of shame on the part of the SPD."
"125","POSITIVE","Excellent! This is free journalism."
"126","NEGATIVE","Not wanting to publish... no problem. Everything is recorded and then someone can rob the recordings and replay them anonymously, or commemorative protocol like the Trump... then a heed... that can't be so bad, because Mr. Ka is on the FDGO, the liberal basic order... he has a legal prexamen managed as a real specialist in the SPD."
"127","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúIt was only recently that the party held a press conference in which it accused the protection of the Constitution ‚Äî once again ‚Äî of being politically instrumentalised. ‚Äú

Anyone who has been monitoring the constitutional protection processes since Chemnitz can certainly gain this insight. Mr Haldenwang came into this office for a certain reason, and that's exactly how a Mr. Stegner also clapped it on Twitter."
"128","NEGATIVE","Johannes Kahrs is not the brightest candle on the birthday cake, although he would certainly say so."
"129","NEUTRAL","Kahrs brings the feat to compete Stegner and Maas as as the most unsympathetic SPD politician. 
And remove AFDler from civil servants? Are you still okay? The spd probably thinks the state belongs to her. Very confident of a party that is elected only by 15% and most of them only by habit. 
My prognosis is that the AfD will survive the spd."
"130","NEUTRAL","Half of the police can be fired."
"131","NEGATIVE","Perhaps Mr. Kahrs should rather take care of his own party, that promises less publicity, but there is God knows enough construction sites..."
"132","POSITIVE","Whether you like the AfD or not, its strength is a product and reflection of the German politics of recent years. People like Kahrs should better reflect on it than pubbling around unqualified."
"133","NEUTRAL","Well then the SPD can banning all parties except the SPD. Then it creates election results of 99.6%. This worked fine in the GDR.

And the fascists from the New Forum, environmental groups, etc. were patiently explained in the prisons why the workers and peasants defend socialist democracy..."
"134","NEGATIVE","Yes, on this credo the socialist dictatorships were built: anything that is not socialist is fascist per se, that is, anti-democratic and is prohibited."
"135","NEUTRAL","After Mr Habeck has expressed clear sympathy for the shaping power of a totalitarian state (China), the protection of the Constitution should also look at the Greens."
"136","NEUTRAL","Why? Mr. Kahrs is with the SPD."
