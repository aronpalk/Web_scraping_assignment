"1","NEUTRAL","First of all, starting to think would be a step. What's true is that D, and hence the Groko, has no strategy. The main thing is to distribute what supposedly there..."
"2","MIXED","Think of the middle class and cheap energy. That's big enough for now."
"3","NEGATIVE","Ridiculously not saying anything!!!
 Has the kindergarten politician ever worked something??? 
... offspring hope??
 Rather direction 5% accelerator"
"4","POSITIVE","Don't think big... just and meaningful would be a start."
"5","POSITIVE","People are ready!"
"6","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúThink bigger! ‚ÄúNo Mr. Amthor probably most people have long not expected this from the CDU and certainly not until a sustainable social consensus is finally found in the migration policy that is overshadowed by all areas.
The disappointment of uncontrolled immigration and its consequences for four years has long become resentment, rejection and loss of confidence. 
Annual spending of ‚Ç¨50-70 billion on refugees at the expense of all taxpayers, loss of prosperity, security, rising crime, overwhelmed authorities and a deeply divided society are no longer acceptable! 
In view of these circumstances, the CDU should be a requirement - small, but legally compliant, consistent action in migration policy rather than thinking bigger! That's what the citizens expect!"
"7","NEUTRAL","Somewhere you learn to talk a lot without saying anything. Again, there is only the youth form of self-employment of the CDU. You'd have to... Politics. 

The CDU is still in power and can act. If the federal government becomes as ungovernable at the latest in 2021 as in the last state elections, then ‚ÄúGood Night‚Äù.
The CDU has only one chance to use the year 2020 to act with the more conservative forces such as Mr. Amthor, thereby reintegrating the conservative protest voters into your electorate in 2021. As a routine interim man, Mr. Merz is at the helm of clear words and then builds up a young successor.
But this also includes already in 2020: 
Tax reform fast, top tax rate again at five times or even ten times average income, then also like high
Abolition Solos
Internal security through genuine police presence and systematic enforcement of existing court decisions/administrative decisions
Real accelerating laws in the infrastructure sector, where not every association with state subsidisation by the authorities is allowed to sue; judges who make clear and quick judgments and, if necessary, are protected by ministerial decrees
End with the redistribution, performance must be worthwhile again
Solar systems and storage of electricity for private households
Technology openness

Let's go, but not until 2021! Now it's true!!"
"8","NEUTRAL","How did he get into the Bundestag?"
"9","POSITIVE","The right question!!!! üëç"
"10","NEUTRAL","Can you expect that from him too;)?"
"11","NEUTRAL","What are you doing? Think bigger, maybe the gentlemen should start thinking. And look around the country, infrastructure broken or backwoods, schools that are marauding, a judiciary that is often no longer comprehensible, a downgraded Bundeswehr, an unsolved problem of migrants and asylum seekers, open borders. And then a party congress as a salvation bearer. It's like our greatest chancellor ever itches what's decided. I remember a party congress resolution to abolish dual citizenship. What did our GKaZ say? I won't. Maybe the gentlemen should exchange their entire management staff. With people who can't even descend a staircase, there's no future to make."
"12","NEUTRAL","That's all there is to say."
"13","POSITIVE","People do not expect the Greater Thinking but to listen to Thinking and above all! Listen to the people!"
"14","POSITIVE","Not ‚Äúthinking‚Äù, finally ‚Äúacting‚Äù. Phantasten, dream dancers, etc. we already have enough."
"15","NEGATIVE","Would be nice if some politicians start thinking at all. We've had bigger before!"
"16","NEUTRAL","But blame must also be allowed to apply. I wish that all politicians should be honest and, once someone built Murks, stand for it. This is particularly true of Mrs Merkel."
"17","POSITIVE","Little Philip thinks big, sweet, if it wasn't so scary..."
"18","NEGATIVE","I must disagree with Mr A. The CDU has to change a huge amount of power. Boundaries dense, consistent deportation, reducing the excessive benefits of migrants or at least giving the Germans the same benefits, reimplementing the separation of powers, abolishing the oversupply of politicians, introducing primary elections..."
"19","POSITIVE","When you read Mr Amthor's article and answers, it is clear again why many citizens turn away from politics or choose parties that are not well regarded here.
Every bit is sold as a success and is justified by many words that hardly anyone understands. 
Simpler and clearer words, which will then also be translated into deeds - that is what the mature citizen wants to have. 
In current politics, a lot of bla-blah is done, but little or if only worked with so many hooks and eyelets that no ordinary citizen can understand this anymore. (You basic pension a bureaucracy monster)

I remember there was once a politician who was highly esteemed by me, who wanted to take the tax on a beer mat, so that every citizen understands what he has to pay. But such people are or were simply put cold by the chancellor."
"20","NEUTRAL","I think Amthor and Merz at the lead of the CDU would certainly harmonize well."
"21","POSITIVE","‚ÄúPeople expect us to think bigger ‚Äú.
Yeah, but it's been about, or at least, 12 years. A part of the population thinks in my opinion often and in some things much further - since you already have to saddle a pretty fast horse, that you follow it - Mr. Amthor has something from Lucky Luke, at least the mouth is as fast and clever as Luck Luke's pistol belt - when it comes to it, smart and purposeful, -)! 

To Annegret! The CDU would be, but this is more my sentiment, I can't judge it, about 5-6% higher in the voter favor - it represents the CDU miserably - a party leader has to provide brightening internally as well as representative!? (if AM has weakened health in episodes)."
"22","NEGATIVE","From many of the sentences that Mr Amthor says here, it sounds: ‚ÄúIf she would finally resign! It does not make any progress!‚Äù. This concerns GroKo, but also and above all Mrs Merkel, who sacrificed all the principles on the altar of preserving power both for her party and for Germany. 

And whoever qualifies Mr Amthor as a pimp without professional experience has two things to say: firstly, he does at least something, he actively does politics. If you don't like him, you don't have to choose him. Secondly, is what he says here wrong just because he's not such a cool sock visually? What I have heard from him so far can always keep up with the public effusions of a former children's book author, a party careerist or a former start-up consultant, all of whom hold executive posts."
"23","NEUTRAL","@Heiner M.: 
‚ÄúAnd who qualifies Mr. Amthor as a pimp without professional experience‚Äù 

And thirdly, he graduated in law with predicate exams. That's what you have to do first."
"24","POSITIVE","Philip Amthor unfortunately also has the entire range of speech bubbles and phrases on it like the colleague. Nevertheless, I think that if you let him, he could well mature into an impetus, because he's probably intelligent. I recently saw him in a round with renowned historians, so he did very well. I wish him a good standing."
"25","NEGATIVE","In the late Merkel years, Philipp Amthor is one of the few conservative spotlights, and yet so young.
Unfortunately, we have to endure the groko of the ‚Äúconcerned‚Äù and ‚Äútaxpayers‚Äù for another two years. Then it would be enough for me to finally tackle the main issues - migration, education, pensions, instead of constantly driving new pigs through the village with a lot of shouting.
It remains to be hoped that the majority of the current active generation of politicians will retire with Mrs Merkel. The Philipp Amthor, of course, does not, the 
can't stay the must. Socialists, the Republic has enough."
"26","NEGATIVE","So I don't expect to think bigger at first. I expect it to be implemented. For me, it's all the same. First we discuss until everyone is dizzy. Then some semi-trade-off will be found, which will never be implemented. Citizens pay all the misery, and the ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù pay for lifelong full care. 
I don't think it's really good and fair. It's rather pathetic."
"27","POSITIVE","My opinion on Mr Amthor is: Young, dynamic & determined. With the season handover he will probably have to wait a little while, since currently other protagonists are still on the move; -) That means patience and good luck!"
"28","POSITIVE","Thinking at all. That would be something. Don't have to be the same size."
"29","NEGATIVE","As long as the old squads that have messed up the matter do not resign and new unspent brains (with heart) create a new clear line, it will be nothing more with the great people's parties. But there is absolutely no need for a small revolution from below, because it is human that the failed say that ‚Äúwe are not to blame, we have done so much right‚Äù that is just human, because it needs a push from below. If the offspring in this embarrassing situation is not able to hit the table once really hard, then they are the same failures as their ‚Äúsuperiors‚Äù. Amthor is still young and, in my opinion, has a pragmatic, intelligent and conservative approach. Working together with other sensible people, I could certainly imagine an improvement in the political and social situation."
"30","NEGATIVE","‚Äú... Personnel discussions generally seem to generate more interest than substantive discussions, but they do not help us any further...‚Äù

Very correctly recognized Mr. Amthor. 
It is very likely that this is a structural personnel problem.

People who like to deal with substantive issues sit in the very German economic sectors which are under attack by politics via over-regulation, high electricity prices, taxes, and climate hysteria.

In politics and affiliated circles there is another blow of human beings. And what Mr Amthor describes here is the logical consequence.

Proposal to address the structural personnel problem:
1. Abolition of list places to exclude the low-wheeled followers
2. Quota for scientists and engineers in the Bundestag (should not be a problem in times of women's quotas)"
"31","NEUTRAL","Aha - fresh wind at the CDU. Words sharp as square cartridges. You can see how this youthful hot spur promises ideals, analyzes mistakes and works on the future without wasting an opportunistic thought of a boring party career. ‚ÄúThe oldest 26 year old in the world‚Äù I once heard about him somewhere. A CDU embryo like cloned."
"32","POSITIVE","I expect you to even think. The politics of the last few years have been completely brainless."
"33","NEGATIVE","What please should ‚Äúthink bigger‚Äù bring if it fails on ‚Äúthink right‚Äù. Without life and professional experience - only with a ‚Äúbreadless art study‚Äù is enough only for contentless chatter. But this type of politician is currently inflationary across all parties and celebrates itself as great visionaries."
"34","POSITIVE","I don't know why you, dear world, the Green Top Duo and H. Amthor from the CDU get so many thin aritcles or interviews that should only inflate their ego even further - and only dilute the already sparse content in the inflated space even further. 

Please, please, don't go on like that. They think they're doing something right afterwards. Speaking of true: thrust reversal is a braking process, especially in aircraft turbines. I can't imagine H.Amthor wanted to criticize his Chancellor so violently."
"35","NEUTRAL","A young chatter, already fully involved in party work for unconditional preservation of power."
"36","NEUTRAL","Amthor for Chancellor, the German Sebastian Kurz! ;)"
"37","NEUTRAL","At Amthor I always think of the fire tongs bowle, what is a steam engine? ü§ì"
"38","NEUTRAL","It is not only ‚Äúprogrammatic gaps‚Äù that have led to the desolate election results of the CDU, but rather personnel gaps, as can also be seen from Philipp Amthor's hopefully for young talent."
"39","NEUTRAL","Mr Amthor, thanks to the media, people now have a much better insight into the action of the so-called People's Party. Under Kohl and Schmidt, we were much less in the way the party leaders came to their decisions. 

Today it looks somewhat different, as we are now seeing our ministers shoot one buck at a time. (Toll, Gorsch Fock, etc.) The so-called expertise of industry consultants costs the taxpayer billions. 
Depending on the wind situation, the old ship CDU drives more or less power and guidance at sea.
The tired helmsman has retired into his cabin, the rest of the crew is engaged in career planning and personal security. Old men in their masssuits smell your last chance of a little more power to possibly open a few new doors to the old employer.
 
When the new generation of professional politicians such as Kevin K√ºhnert, or you too, Mr Amthor, talk about visions that affect a substantial part of the population without having worked a single day in life, some people rightly see it very critical.

Begin to critically question your own actions, and stop to rule on the just popular activist behind."
"40","NEGATIVE","He, too, unfortunately, didn't understand anything.

1. Think not ‚Äúbig‚Äù, but with expertise and foresight. Contexts and draw the right conclusions. 

2. Personal questions are never beautiful, but often inevitable if something is to change.

As long as no will is recognizable here, and I don't see much with the CDU, it will go further down."
"41","NEUTRAL","Keep that big kid off my neck. How can one identify with Amthor, a party soldier before the Lord?"
"42","POSITIVE","Philipp Amthor the Biedermeier time come true! Regulated teaching instrument of the CDU."
"43","POSITIVE","Dear Mr. Amthor, ‚ÄúPeople expect us to think bigger.‚Äù
I have to smile.
I would be glad if the ruling politicians even thought.
No matter whether big or small.

In recent years there has been a strong impression that this is only trying to secure one's own post, satisfy lobbyists, chasing loud shouting extremes, in order to calm them down or to sink taxpayers' money in social projects."
"44","NEUTRAL","The young politician with the charisma of a sleeping pill wants to ‚Äúthink bigger‚Äù in the CDU. Oh, so.
Why is that so little credible?
Mr Amthor realised correctly that the CDU, in the style of the SPD, is less concerned with voters and their concerns than with itself. There should be scheduled."
"45","NEGATIVE","I think you have not analyzed that correctly, Mr. Amthor.
I cannot recognize the handwriting of a CDU in the long reign that the CDU now had.
I see only bad compromises to support the SPD, which desperately spends our future in order to bribe a few million voters here or there.
I do not expect a government to pursue a supposed mainstream, but to clean up and make the great grievances that are currently in place.
Pension, overwhelming social systems, overwhelming state, tax laws, immigration systems, criminal laws, health system, education, research, infrastructure, sustainability, energy system! (list is not complete and no weighting) All ticking time bombs that require more than one cosmetic treatment!
Become a visionary, Mr. Amthor!"
"46","NEGATIVE","Amthor can't become visionary. The only thing he does is babbling about is what the party leader allows. This guy somehow reminds me of Heinrich Mann's ‚Äúsubject.‚Äù
He should take the second state examination, work for a few years as a lawyer, judge or company and gain experience outside the Bundestag. Then he can come back for me. In a Lanz show a few weeks ago, Amthor was performed by the actor Sigl (mountain doctor) according to the rules of art. It hurt already.

The Amthor is relevant for the generation 60plus. In his age cohort, unfortunately, no flower pot can be won."
"47","NEUTRAL","A phrase that has to be put on the tongue: ‚ÄúWhen I think of migration, for example, we have broken a Gordian knot with the expert immigration law and the Geordernete-Reeckkehr-Gesetz (Ordernete-Reeck-Gesetz) without having adequately acknowledged it in the public.‚Äù
Neither of the two laws has provided the state with sufficient management to intervene more effectively than before in the process of migration.
The news has been the same for years, and in a recent past - especially here at Welt online - there are more reports that migration from regions with a tendency to be poor in specialities is increasing again and a ‚Äúnew‚Äù Budapest is starting.

Mr. Amthor and his CDU friends should finally realise that it is not enough to give laws great names. Otto ordinary consumers will only recognise an ‚Äúorderly return law‚Äù as such if it leads to a visible change in the news situation and also in the street image (- malice word -). As long as one (- large order -) has half a million people who leave the country, and only 50 people per month by the said law, such a law is predominantly electoral assistance for the political countries by putting the state demand in the spotlight."
"48","NEGATIVE","It's not half a million, but 80,000 with an exit title in his pocket are allowed to continue setting up here. In addition, a deportation that costs the taxpayer more than a year of Hartz IV reference."
"49","POSITIVE","Vision, Concept, Implementation!! This is all value-conservative!! That's enough!

Now he would only have to know what annoys the citizens of Germany. But even if you tell politics, it doesn't understand! Because can't be what cannot be!!"
"50","POSITIVE","Wrong, Mr Amthor, people do not expect you to think bigger, but that you think more clearly and in the interests of the voter. No more and no less!"
"51","NEUTRAL","Even with (greater) thinking, the contradiction begins, not to mention action. The problems and mistakes created by this party, such as energy transition, breach of the EU treaties, disrupted infrastructure, BW chaos, old age poverty, housing shortages, migration with the serious consequential damages up to the current need test for pensions, etc., confirm the total incapacity of the so-called representatives of this party. Everywhere construction sites and only squatting, typical - we have to think bigger -. What is missing behind and in front are personalities with competence who could rebuild trust with their actions. As long as you hear only phrases: ‚Äúwe will, we should, we are there, etc.‚Äù by the xmal cross-offset failures such as AKK, Altmaier, Seehofer, Scheuer, etc., this CDU/CSU continues to earn downwards. The hope that the party congress will bring the turn is more than small. The Merkelfelt and the fear of losing their own hands is too strong, a renewal can only be initiated by further voter losses."
"52","POSITIVE","Everyone wants CO2 free energy but in no case atom. Wind power is hot, but if the landscape is spared or the high valleys are devastated with reservoirs. Wash my fur but don't make me wet is the motto. I would be happy if politics and the media were to think again at all."
"53","NEUTRAL","Mr. Amthor is right. The CDU in Germany is making itself small.‚Äù, we have broken a Gordian knot with the Skilled Immigration Act and the Geordernete-R√ºckkehr-Gesetz, without having adequately appreciated it in public opinion.‚Äù The CDU - politicians in the European Parliament are already significantly further than that by adopting the EU Resolution 

'European Parliament resolution of 26 March 2019 on the fundamental rights of people of African descent in Europe (2018/2899 (RSP)) '

have signed. 

This resolution, with just under 30 points, was long overdue 

Excerpts: ‚Äú17. Calls on Member States to end the creation of racial or ethnic profiles in all forms of law enforcement, counter-terrorism and immigration control...
22.... to tackle discrimination against people of African descent in the housing market and to address inequalities in access to housing with concrete measures and to ensure adequate housing conditions;

23.... to ensure that migrants, refugees and asylum seekers can enter the EU safely and legally, taking into account existing legislation and procedures. ‚Äú WORTH READING.
It is a welcome fact that no upper limit is mentioned and that the resettlementprogramme is already running through flights from Eritrea and Uganda to Kassel Airport. 
That and how to think bigger is discussed at the party congress and then communicated to the public.

"54","POSITIVE","Great, these are really the FACTS. Next to this, we will present the UN MIGRATION PACT. Then you can see clearly when you want. But, of course, the demand for the management of the camps in Libya by the UNHCR, including the guarding and protection against the militias that deal with refugees, etc. is absolutely justified and necessary. Then the Greens party congress resolution to bring Syrian refugees from Turkey to Germany and open the borders. And in the same breath, to impose sanctions on Turkey! The Greens are against the camps and want to bring these refugees, mainly economic refugees to Germany. This would be in the sense of the UN Migration Pact, according to which economic refugees have exactly the same status as political refugees under the right of asylum."
"55","NEGATIVE","‚ÄúIn climate policy, we had too long a programmatic gap that cost us voices‚Äù
How can you lie so far away? Environmental protection is important for most people, but other issues are crucial to the election. Topics on which the CDU is experiencing a counter-attitude and which it does not want to admit. With further doctoring in the wrong place, only more voter frustration comes up. The Permanent Slatch Party Days still hang in the head of many figuratively. Every one of the wrong decisions was cordially clapped. How should we start from a change in the party?"
"56","NEUTRAL","A young Yuppie explains to us what the CDU should become in future. The basic problems such as migration and pension chaos are hidden. He has the charisma of a financial officer and is supposed to bring the youth to the CDU. Unfortunately, the youth have already turned to Mr Habeck because he is more in line with the trend of the time. Mr. Amthor can't stink in a suit. Much too bieder and spit and no clear announcements. A young rebellious Friedrich M√§rz could perhaps be points-rebellious and value-conservative with visions. A counter-pole to Merkel and AKK. 
Another alternative to the ailing SPD, the left and the left-bent CDU. Even the CSU sees beekeeping as its primary objective - I have not heard Mr S√∂der already heard about securing the external borders, internal security and deportation of the rejected. Just clumsy anbiederei to the Greens to make good weather at a possible black-green government sometime in the future. Maybe there as vice chancellor to get further?
Sorry Mr. Amthor- this will be nothing with the new CDU in old hoses-but you still have a certain maintenance value."
"57","NEUTRAL","The migration problem is solved in a big way.
Please read 
 European Parliament resolution of 26 March 2019 on the fundamental rights of people of African descent in Europe (2018/2899 (RSP))."
"58","POSITIVE","I would think right enough. Bigger has a ‚Äúflavored‚Äù"
"59","NEUTRAL","Mr. Amthor should look at the history of the CDU. The CDU's programme consisted of the doctrine of the respective chairperson (s). A successful chancellor succession could never be achieved. He would also include in his reflections on where he and Paul Ziemiak would stand if the policy of the former ex-chancellor Kurt-Georg Kiesinger had been followed. At the same time, he must also consider how long it took Helmut Kohl to bundle corresponding majorities within the CDU behind him and then be able to assert a constructive vote of no confidence. In the constellation Kiesinger-Perschel this was not possible. If he then critically deals with the beginning of Angela Merkel's chancellor and the voter punished ‚Äúlook of love‚Äù with Westerwelles FDP, it should be clear to him that political policy has not been a core competence of the CDU for a long time. Against this background, he must not be surprised that the personnel question is quite justified."
"60","NEUTRAL","We should rather think more focused and become aware of our core competencies and values, without permanently addressing a mainstream that has created itself in order to have a right to exist at all."
"61","NEGATIVE","I cannot help myself, but it is precisely this kind of politician that discourages me from choosing this party, even though the content intersections would exist..."
"62","POSITIVE","Amthor, Bauhnert, Baerbock... The future of German politics! 
If I hadn't already emigrated, now would be a good time!"
"63","NEUTRAL","@Kristian A.
Where are you going, where it's better than here?"
"64","NEGATIVE","They will not be able to meet these expectations. You can't even make the little things reasonable."
"65","NEUTRAL","I read the same thing as in the headline 2 days ago from Habeck."
"66","NEGATIVE","‚ÄúPeople expect us to think a bit bigger.‚Äù
Mr Amthor should ask himself what his own claim and that of his party is. Wanting only to ‚Äúpeople‚Äù is opportunism in pure culture!
Of course, the question of personnel is at the heart of the electorate's deliberations, especially since assurances and treaties do not mean anything for today's politicians.
A totally messed up young man, this politician."
"67","NEGATIVE","Quote Amthor: ‚ÄúOn the other hand, we sometimes insecure our regular voters with an unclear language.‚Äù In my opinion, Mr Amthor is not a bearer of hope, but nothing but one of these younger party pupils, filled with bureaucratic language and nebulous statements, which bring forth all parties (Zit: the government coalition is ‚Äúnot a key driver for visions‚Äù). This also includes phrases such as ‚Äúavoiding blame‚Äù. Mr Amthor is far from Mr M√§rzen's clear speech, and seems to be preparing for a waited and unpositioned leadership position. Even the outfit is similar, for example, to the Foreign Minister Mass or Mr Scheuer. I mean, oh, God, it's a shame for the CDU."
"68","POSITIVE","Mr Amthor, the citizens were delighted if ever thought was made."
"69","NEUTRAL","Actually, it doesn't matter what Mr Amthor has for ideas and visions. After the next Bundestag election there will be a black/green/red government. There won't be much left of the CDU."
"70","NEUTRAL","People would be happy if the CDU even started thinking."
"71","NEGATIVE","Phala... Insolence, such a remark, no matter what party. Blames without substantive substance."
"72","NEGATIVE","As long as the CDU and the mistakes made in particular do not try to fix, it will be nothing with Mr Amthor's great sayings. Mr Merz has raised these points several times, unfortunately, there is no capacity to act, and the party is still not credible."
"73","POSITIVE","What brings us great thinking when we only act small?"
"74","POSITIVE","Amthor embodies a blow of politicians that really no one needs. Politics must finally be made by people out of society again. How should one develop a sense of what and for whom one makes politics with a delivery hall career?"
"75","NEUTRAL","It is enough for the current challenges to be implemented in accordance with the Basic Law. 

But it seems difficult for the parties to develop a vision for our state and implement it sustainably and collectively.

Maybe listen to Dieter Nuhr more often. Could help."
"76","NEUTRAL","People also expect that today's problems that have arisen over the last 4 years will be solved!
With deeds and not with more words."
"77","POSITIVE","It is a mistake that the CDU ignores all surveys for critical assessment of AKKs in the population. Merz is consistently seen as the better chancellor candidate. He has the format, votes and the sovereignty it takes to go through difficult situations. This question should not be stifled in the bud in the CDU. Amthor is an intelligent man. There are not so many of these in politics at the moment. This is also due to the fact that everyone, but also everyone in politics, can attain positions and posts. Access requirements as required in any other profession would be time. Too many dropouts and screaming necks that are fired medially (see left-green). Proverbs and vocabulary as it is sexy in puberty, do the WRR well? ‚ÄúNonsense and Pillepalle‚Äù as favorite terms of the left-greens, well-founded knowledge - misindication? Intelligence, knowledge, critical questioning oneself, prudence. That's out. There are people like Amthor, Merz, Lindner temporarily cold. Medially and partly in their own parties. The more the demands on education are reduced, the higher the chances for the planned economy (naive state faith and supply mentality) and thus left-green fantasies increase. Even if you do not participate in all the positions of Amthor, the differentiated view is at least beneficial."
"78","POSITIVE","Monika: finally a differentiated contribution with substance and arguments. Many Blamers should set themselves as a bar for their contributions!"
"79","NEGATIVE","After Mr Amthor's disappointing and visionless answers, I fully agree with the CDU leader in Baden-W√ºrttemberg:
He described the CDU as ‚Äúinsolvent in terms of content ‚Äú."
"80","POSITIVE","Mr Amthor, when at last this party will act again and make politics for the people. For years I've only heard speech bubbles and words that do not follow deeds. You should not think ‚Äúbigger‚Äù, but start at all."
"81","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúPersonnel decisions are not pending.‚Äù

If you notice in a company that the company is driving in front of the wall, then the Supervisory Board cannot wait until the Board of Management goes to the insolvency judge, but must throw out the incapable CEO and counteract it. 

If the CDU continues to rely on the incapable AKK and on the consumed chancellor, the CDU will face a huge bankruptcy no later than 2021.

I am - quite frankly sorry too - to have a 26-year-old self-in love smart guy who doesn't even have the second state law exam to explain the world. He's just babbling about what's in the party en vogue. If the CDU continues, it shares the fate of the SPD in 2021. 20%
Then she can either be the stirrup holder for the Greens or regenerate in opposition when G2R rules.

Great visions or great thinking cannot be expected from the current party leadership. The CDU had 14 years to do so. Instead of doing great things, big crap would be tapped. Especially in recent years."
"82","NEGATIVE","Mrs Merkel already has a vision: the working population is replaced by more demanding foreigners who are not entitled to vote. The remaining Germans form an upper class that lives well on it. You feel good because you give so many people a chance and can afford a lot of ecology.
Okay, the social security funds collapse because there are a lot of people who can't work. But the upper class entitled to vote is not really interested in this, since it has always been unaware that this is socialist mischief."
"83","NEUTRAL","Unfortunately, Mr Amthor is also a typical groko chatter with the usual professional politician phrases. Certainly no one expects visions from the CDU, but pragmatic solutions that will also be successfully implemented, and not that it will be effectively controlled by the SPD and the Greens."
"84","NEGATIVE","‚ÄúIt is not about a flat-rate exclusion, but about a legally safe and manageable solution. But we urgently need these, as I share the concern that the participation of Chinese equipment suppliers can jeopardize the security of our country. 5G is no longer just about telecommunications, it becomes the basis for smart cities, telemedicine and our critical infrastructure.‚Äù
Apparently, Mr Amthor is hiding the events surrounding the NSA and the Chancellor's mobile phone. Currently, it is also difficult to identify legal certainty with our American partners."
"85","NEUTRAL","I have to go Big..."
"86","NEUTRAL","Mr Amthor, too, thinks in dimensions that will make the CDU a junior partner of the Greens in one of the next elections. No, you won't win elections with 5G."
"87","NEUTRAL","It would be enough for the Union to do its homework. Securing the EU's external borders and deportation of illegal migrants are on the agenda. At least we now have a competent IM in North Rhine-Westphalia and a good Ministry of Education with the FDP. At least a glimpse of light. Once the store is tidy, you can face bigger tasks."
"88","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúPeople expect us to think bigger‚Äù

It would be enough for me to act in the interests of the majority."
"89","NEUTRAL","Programs of the CDU are not worth the paper on which they are written: read what positions the CDU has expressed in electoral programmes on migration, marriage, the Bundeswehr, dual citizenship, nuclear power, etc. p.p. We got the opposite!"
"90","NEUTRAL","No, people expect you to even think."
"91","NEUTRAL","Mr Amthor strongly reminds me of my daughter's Communion celebration last year. That's where the boys walked around.
Honestly, what do these young bubs have to report today? Just like that Kevin with the yellow teeth.
No political experience, no significant achievements but always pretend to have taken up wisdom with the spoons"
"92","NEGATIVE","The young boy wants to explain the world to me? He's never worked properly. ‚ÄúProfessional politician lives in Berlin carefree zone‚Äù is called this. Make 20 years of real work your living, then we can talk."
"93","NEGATIVE","Please don't! It's enough for me to get your hands on the everyday things. The construction of an airport, the provision of sufficient teaching staff or a modern tax policy."
"94","NEUTRAL","Mr Amthor: For example, when I think of migration, we have broken a Gordian knot with the skilled immigration law and the Ordernete-Return law, without having sufficiently appreciated this in public opinion.

What should be good about a professional immigration law that allows entry without proof of an employment contract in advance? We live in the digital age and everyone can apply online worldwide... and the - ordered - return - law - has exactly what demonstrable actions lead to? As we can see from the prominent example of Miri, the persons liable to leave, deportees and those with immigration remain foolproof.... This state is overwhelmed in many areas... because much - predominantly in terms of migration - has gone out of control. Not to mention other issues such as climate policy, etc....
In what cloud cuckoo home does Mr. Amthor live??"
"95","NEGATIVE","The problem is that it is hardly anyone who is expected to think bigger."
"96","NEGATIVE","Not only do I trust no one there, I am sure that this ability is simply not available among Berlin politicians."
"97","NEUTRAL","He was never really anything other than professional politician.At 16, he went to the young Union and then climbed ambitiously the intra-party mapping ladder uppor.sponsored by the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung. A ‚Äúparteinhen‚Äù foundation and then he worked as an employee in the parliament and the Bundestag until he became himself the 2nd youngest member. He has learned his ‚Äú"" Handwetk""""So actually on the pike on and that's just.. the talking!!! in not-sensational words.. always non-binding and the topics that move or even disturb people, .we leave out.. before it becomes concrete and unpleasant. Beautifully put the coat of soothing hypnosis over it.‚Äù Everything is fine. Everything under control. .calms further sleep.‚Äù How should a P.Amthor understand the worries and fears of a normal worker? He was always promoted and supported by the party, to the goal, a place in the Bundestag.. or would he also like to become chancellor? ?"
"98","NEUTRAL","I expect you to think of the Germans, German culture, German achievements, etc. and that has nothing to do with nationalism but with common sense.
Even most immigrants who are diligent and have come here to take advantage of the opportunities that Germany offers them do not understand this policy of perpetual tolerance.
The problem is an overwhelming sense of ideology and the resulting enmity towards our society, our values and our culture.
Our Basic Law is good, but it simply needs to be adapted and it must not be overridden by anyone, either a person (and be it Chancellor) or by an institution (the EU).
This country needs reforms and cuts, but these must be to strengthen social coexistence and to separate the chaff from wheat.
Law and Order is needed for this at the moment, and goodness and tolerance do not help."
"99","POSITIVE","Great action of the grand coalition would rather me think big..."
"100","NEUTRAL","First grow up, then think big ones. Oh, yeah, and talking big is another thing."
"101","NEUTRAL","Mr. Amthor has certainly been the interview with green boss Habeck, who complains that Germany thinks ‚Äútoo small ‚Äúand now demands himself to think better."
"102","NEUTRAL","How can Mr Amthor give away these words?
Always nice to talk the problems small and try with semantic means to catch one or another voter still. 
This is not a program. 
The CDU has become arbitrary and Gda≈Ñsk can be exchanged for Greens, SPD or AfD."
"103","NEUTRAL","It must be said that the CDU has become arbitrary and then against the Greens, the SPD or the FDP."
"104","NEUTRAL","Most people would be completely impressed if you listened to them, understand their worries, and then think about them.

Solutions are then phase 2 and these to communicate intelligently beforehand then part of it.

The CDU in the first place and the majority of the others have lost the people.

Why is the left-liberal green elected, although most people like driving and eating steaks, or just right-blue, although certainly the majority of AfD voters are not dangerous fascists or human enemies?

At this point, BIG THINGS would be allowed."
"105","NEUTRAL","The CDU will not become a popular party again, because it has now been hijacked by ‚Äúleft-green‚Äù and people like Comrade Guenther & co have something to say there! All under the direction of the great chairman of the Council of State, Mrs Merkel! Today it crumbles between Greens and AFD! If Guenther speaks for the CDU and you have the feeling that he could also be in the Left Party, then the member and the voter also resigned. If climate change and mobility policy turn into a green policy light, then one chooses the Greens. If you want to protect your country from overalienation and preserve your culture, then you choose the bourgeois - conserbvative AFD, because what else does not remain! Or you go out! 
What I find sad with such a young politician is the non-binding, non-meaningful words. Typical professional politician meanwhile. No backbone clearly to take position and the dance around the pink elephant in the room."
"106","NEGATIVE","‚ÄúPeople expect us to think bigger‚Äù

I'm not. They have economized Germany in the last few years in a horrible way, and subsequent generations will have to nibble forever. 
And whenever they want to ‚Äúthink bigger‚Äù at best, little or nothing comes out, but often something that the electoral people do not want at all but have to bathe."
"107","NEUTRAL","@Joe Hannis
I also believe that we will have quite serious problems with the state of our infrastructure and we will face even worse problems if we do not invest quickly.

But downgraded? Where are you? Isn't we pretty good? Recession forecasts in recent years have not yet occurred, private consumption is at full speed, and there have never been more employees in Germany with social security obligations than now. And if there is still an investment in infrastructure, then hardly any recession will occur in the next few years, will it?"
"108","NEGATIVE","The CDU can reinvent itself from me and MODERING in a handstand soon, demm it is no longer for a long time. They'll never get my voice again."
"109","NEGATIVE","Such people have still not noticed what people want. Just beautiful rhetoric from her bubble. What are they disappointing."
"110","POSITIVE","The interview could also be done with a 14-year-old. Purely visual and content."
"111","NEUTRAL","You don't understand everything he says, but the impression remains that he can Chancellor."
"112","POSITIVE","I will never understand that there are people with so low expectations that these lower mediocrity can perceive as ‚Äúoutstanding‚Äù.
Unintentionally, this statement says a lot about the own aspiration of this generation!"
"113","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúThe fact that we stand so badly has to do with the fact that we make ourselves the SPD mistake of creating the impression of permanent self-employment to the outside.‚Äù 

Very much me different... The fact that the CDU is so bad is more likely to do with bad politics."
"114","NEUTRAL","For example, ‚ÄúOrderned-Return Law‚Äù. It's not about a kind of Giffey baking cake law, but about the successful execution of such a law."
"115","NEUTRAL","I don't expect anything from the so-called CDU anymore. What I cannot expect, however, is the day when the AFD, which is today's CDU, Mr Amthor and co. coalition talks. The day will come when a Muslim party does not already have the majority among the voters."
