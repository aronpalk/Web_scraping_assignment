"1","NEGATIVE","The system change is already fully underway, many just do not notice it at their own level. The impact of these changes will give this country a different face. And by that I don't mean “we can do this”. Those who, however, have given us this up, will no longer be there, or blame all other circumstances for their own failure."
"2","NEUTRAL",">> The Green Chief also called on the CDU to show a clear edge against the AfD and to stop cooperation, no matter what level. <<

Democracy sounds different. 
But I know this form of refusal of dialogue from the most personal experience in many so-called liberal circles."
"3","NEUTRAL","No one intends... system changes always start small and well disguised. Not to let the “expropriation sword” become blunt by frequent mention (Habeck, analogously, at the party convention) shows the blueprint of leading greens. The effect is already visible: in the housing market, in the automotive industry, in the education sector."
"4","NEUTRAL","Well, maybe it's good for the Greens to come to power. Then everyone can see how far the advance laurels are justified. 
I would make a bet that there would be no second parliamentary term with the Greens."
"5","NEUTRAL","I would rather bet that there will be no free elections, in any case, such as we know them..."
"6","NEGATIVE","I do not think that what a political party wants exactly is so crucial. The people are the sovereign, parties participate in the democratic formation of will, but are not empowered by the people to rule."
"7","NEGATIVE","It is always interesting that the smallest party in the BT gets the biggest media platform, but the only opposition that stands for German interests is attacked and discredited. What does this tell us as non-government citizens and as people who think slbst?"
"8","NEGATIVE","I feel it so that the AfD is called at every slightest provocation in the media."
"9","NEUTRAL","I assume that, as a citizen, I have a duty to resist such a “government”."
"10","NEGATIVE","For me, choosing this fatherless prohibition club would mean sending Germany to the abyss the fastest way."
"11","POSITIVE","There's a new game that won't go much faster with it."
"12","NEUTRAL","Bielefeld doesn't exist."
"13","NEUTRAL","What you want... what the population wants that counts."
"14","NEGATIVE","I see no end to the policy of open borders and no incentives for performance providers. Both together lead to the situation that a six-digit number of Germans emigrates and many others withdraw into private life."
"15","NEUTRAL","The CDU is not supposed to make the old mistake of going into coalitions that do not fit together. Another voter leaving would not be able to cope."
"16","NEGATIVE","True, so a coalition with the AfD would be fatal."
"17","NEUTRAL","What should be black and green, did Habeck not learn from the SPD?"
"18","NEUTRAL","What should be black-green? This question is easy to answer: if you mix these colors, you would get dark green, and the result would be even more green. And you have not fully understood this with Habeck and the SPD. He wants Chancellor. God, or whatever gods, keep this land from it."
"19","NEGATIVE","Unfortunately, due to the great wealth in Germany, there are many voters who can finance the huge climate package of the Greens. Poor is getting poorer."
"20","NEGATIVE","Well, I see a good, upscale middle class in my environment. I don't see wealth."
"21","NEGATIVE","Typically German? On the one hand, the inventive standstill policy of GroKo is being moaned. But when someone puts timid proposals for change on the table, like the Greens, it says: Don't experiment! What do you mean?"
"22","NEUTRAL","Experiments are made to achieve better results. Self-destructive experiments just do... choose something for yourself."
"23","NEUTRAL","What do the left and the greens do if the service providers are no longer bogged, reduce performance, emigrate (or their companies) or stop working and get involved in BGE? 
The highest state revenues come from the opponents of the left-Greens. The “unconditional basic income” and other state expenditure can never be unconditional, because at least one condition must be fulfilled: hardworking and innovative must work out this."
"24","POSITIVE","Klaus R.: Easy answer. Look at the Socialists in other countries. The officials all live very well there. They don't care how the people are doing. It's always been like this, it won't change."
"25","POSITIVE","I'm glad he doesn't want a system change. Nevertheless, the Greens are still too extreme for me, not just because of their environmental policy. But before I get the Wende 2.0, I'd rather the Greens!"
"26","NEGATIVE","Mr Habeck, who is well aware of the Chinese system and is of no value to Germany, you want to choose."
"27","NEUTRAL","“We don't want to change the system” 
But many voters do, they don't want to go on like that!"
"28","MIXED","Mr Habeck disagrees with his own statements just a few months ago: we want a system change! And Mrs Baerbock then seconded him by saying that this would also require further prohibitions. Of course, the ecopulists realized that it was not very clever to explain this so openly. But with this, the “green” line has not changed. A party that is essentially only focused on one issue and has so far shown little expertise in economic, foreign and security policy would cause our country even greater damage than the current GroKo. But apparently there are still plenty of voters dreaming of a meadland under green rule."
"29","NEGATIVE","The Greens move straight towards the abyss. With the threat of uniting economic reactionary with social reactionary policies by means of black and green, the Greens are shooting a bullet in their leg. That won't help the Greens in polls. I foresee that the Greens will soon go downhill again, also because I do not want to see any anti-progressive party as a People's Party"
"30","NEGATIVE","A GroKo does not work properly and does not have a good reputation among the population. With black and green, this reputation would be much worse. Black Green would continue to strengthen the AFD. CDU with Greens would form a new GroKo, which would be further left of the center than CDU-SPD."
"31","POSITIVE","The statements rather cast a spotlight on the CDU. The Greens are as they are. Utopians! Like all the leftists!
A.M. has been left for years, but is kept alive artificially by mainstream media.
A CDU alliance can only work with a Federal Chancellor Laschet who is just as arbitrary as A.M.
Ultimately, in our mediocracy, Tina Hassel and Konsorten decides which government we will get.
The next few years will remain exciting!"
"32","POSITIVE","Not with Mr. Laschet, but with Mr. F. Merz!!!!"
"33","NEUTRAL","... it would be all the more important for the CDU to compete with Friedrich Merz."
"34","NEUTRAL","Quote, head of the Green Economic Advisory Council, Danyal Bayaz: “But we want to divert things into key issues of social policy, environmental and economic policy “. 

I fully agree with Mr Bayaz. So far, no alternative. 
Also in terms of the demanded social market economy, I am entirely with Mr. Bayaz. 
Only Mr Bayaz and I have a completely different view of the role of capitalism and personal responsibility for it, and how little state, especially compulsory levies on the part of the service providers, is needed. 

The greens want to see how CDSPDULOT inflate the state and its all-round distribution. 
I want to drain abundant, already existing compressed air. Especially false welfare state practices evaporate. 

If those who earn their income sour have more assets in the wallet, the state can withdraw to its core tasks; security and infrastructure."
"35","NEGATIVE","We don't want a system change, neither do I. It's enough for the '68's to retire."
"36","NEUTRAL","68??? - since the grandpa has these trompeter still swung over the toilet seat..."
"37","NEGATIVE","In DL, things never get better before it's right, I mean right, bad."
"38","NEUTRAL","Where did they get this wisdom?"
"39","NEUTRAL","“We don't want to change the system”

Yes, I do. I want him. Away from A.M.-made self-destruction."
"40","POSITIVE","Of course, black green means a system change. That should be clear to every voter. Then the country will change, and not to its advantage. Competitive will go down the drain, the tax and tax burden will be overwhelming, even for low and normal earners, etc. Hopefully I don't have to experience this anymore, and I can watch from abroad and comfort myself with the thought that I didn't cause it."
"41","POSITIVE","because I can only agree; am glad that we have searched and found a domicile abroad in time"
"42","NEGATIVE","Anyone who wants to rule with Communists himself should be careful to make other rules, who to talk to and who to exclude."
"43","POSITIVE","The former Federal Party Day of the Greens confirmed me in my election. I trust Habeck to be chancellor!"
"44","NEGATIVE","For God's sake, God stand and help. We all don't deserve that much punishment."
"45","POSITIVE","I will not be influenced by green phantasten, whose goals against Germany and against national states at all, are sufficiently well known. There must never be R2G in Germany."
"46","NEUTRAL","We don't want a system change.
We only want people to want what we allow them to seek. Believe what we spread as certainty. Condemn what we recognized as wrong."
"47","POSITIVE","But he can do that very well, threshing phrases like the former People's Parties. On the way up, you probably learn very quickly to adapt and produce hot air. Nothing really concrete can be seen in all this."
"48","NEGATIVE","I can only warn that, according to the paralysing policy of the GroKo, I now want to choose something new under old power, just to make things change. I remind you of Bremen, how quickly the Greens went to bed with the left and the SPD, and this threatens to happen in 2021, and they don't care about your jobs, so think carefully about whether change is always good."
"49","NEUTRAL","The current system should fit the Greens into the concept, so why would they want a change?"
"50","NEUTRAL","“Where has this spirit of thinking the big things in Germany? “ 

Thank God this spirit had disappeared for a long time and should not be awakened."
"51","NEUTRAL","Why does Welt give the Greens with the very benevolent Habeck interview and with “We don't want a system change”, campaign aid.
World should become aware of its roots..."
"52","NEGATIVE","See Christian Democrats and the former workers party...

Verdamp long ago, damp long... in the words of a socially righteous."
"53","NEUTRAL","So a system... Democracy?"
"54","NEUTRAL","“No one wants to build a wall... “😏
😴💤💤😴"
"55","NEUTRAL","The Greens can become very supple in a coalition.
This was noticed by the dumplings they went through with the SPD."
"56","NEUTRAL","2019: “We don't want a system change.”
2012: “There will be no communitization of debts as long as I live.”
1986: “Because one thing is certain: the pension.”
1961: “No one intends to build a wall!”"
"57","NEUTRAL","2021: We want to preserve democracy."
"58","POSITIVE","I am not a party researcher or even a statistician, but I have a sense of realities and my perception of this is a clear picture. More and more hard-working citizens and other real leaders of this society are choosing AFD! Is just a snapshot of my environment but this is quite extensive and I think representative too! Green voters are almost none and that makes me very thoughtful. Who will lead this country, if not the makers?"
"59","NEUTRAL","😂 Let's change the circle of people! In my circle of acquaintances, I know almost only green voters and we all go to work."
"60","NEGATIVE","The Greens are calling for more investment in their party congress and want to sacrifice the black zero in order to supposedly increase the economy. At the same time, Hofreiter demanded an economic situation in the same party congress, which, according to his ideas, will not be an environmental burden. So what investments do the Greens think, which generate economic growth? Certainly none for the growth of industry. This leaves only one economy from the Greens point of view, namely the promotion of green industry. To keep cattle and pigs not in stables but on meadows, to make an agricultural economy without efficient growth through genetic engineering and protection of crops by chemical products, electricity extremely expensive, because it is unfortunately produced by increased area feed somehow ecologically or in new German “sustainable” are certainly no Investments that lead Germany to a modern and necessary economy."
"61","NEUTRAL","This really cannot be imagined: the Greens, who have their roots in a hostile environment and still do not want to credibly distance themselves from it to this day and are still rightly suspected of striving for a system change, are all in favour of observing another party by the protection of the constitutional. 

Apart from that, the Greens and, incidentally, the SPD are panishly afraid of a rapprochement between the CDU and AfD - if that happens, it will be over for a long time with a perspective of power in the sense of participation in the government. For one thing is clear: the majority of voters are bourgeois and vote accordingly, there are political majorities - and not in the left-wing camp."
"62","NEUTRAL","For years, a rapprochement between the SPD, the Greens and the Left was confabulated. What happened to it? Nothing. The distance between the Union and AfD is even many times greater. Within the AfD and its followers, it seems that only one has so far: Höcke"
"63","NEGATIVE","Germany and its own citizens are completely alien to them.
I hope it will soon be the other way around."
"64","POSITIVE","So much innovation in three articles. So much information at once is not even from a SPD party convention. Is that later as a permanent loop on DVD?"
"65","NEUTRAL","From the window"
"66","NEGATIVE","Hopefully these Germany scrapers will soon be away in the window!"
"67","NEUTRAL","Three Habeck articles next to each other.
I could get my breakfast... Well, you know."
"68","NEUTRAL","I want a system change!"
"69","NEGATIVE","Which one do you have in mind? All the previous ones have failed terrific."
"70","POSITIVE","Dream nicely to continue the receipt there when choosing..
Germany no longer needs experiments"
"71","NEUTRAL","One can only wish Habecks and Baerbock, 2021 under government responsibility (with absolute majority?? of the mandates). Then it will be clear whether this present euphoria still continues in 2022, no later than 2023. With Kretschmann, you might suspect it, but under Habeck's and Baerbock's responsibility it would hardly be possible."
"72","NEGATIVE","One must not use over 80 million people for experiments, just as not to prove for the umpteenth time that socialism is not working."
"73","NEGATIVE","It is to be feared that the Greens do not have the necessary economic competence to compensate for the sometimes disastrous economic decisions of the current GroKo.
Germany does not need green dreamers, but professionally competent politicians who, with the necessary assertiveness, know how to get the cow off the ice."
"74","NEGATIVE","- Yes! So at the next election no longer choose tactically, but directly and bluntly AFD.
So far, I have only cast my second vote in favour of preventing the Greens from coming to power. But it's nothing - besides the totally geared adults there are still enough teens who have never earned a penny themselves and are financed by Dad, driven by the eco-teacher to the urn.

M.E. it would be nice if the right to vote is limited to taxpayers and not to age. It is completely absurd that people with dual citizenship are allowed to vote with us at all."
"75","NEUTRAL","Habeck is now the only one who could fill the gap “Merkel” adequately. I don't know any other politician."
"76","NEUTRAL","Yes, given what Mrs Merkel has done so, one can already say that Mr Habeck would be able to continue the chaos."
"77","POSITIVE","I ask God to follow much, better' (close to the people)."
"78","NEGATIVE","And all because everyone is too cowardly to vote for the FDP. Sure there were scandals, but where not? What's worse? A few euros for Moevenpick or a gagged society that can't exploit its potential through ever-new goalings?
For me, the only corrective that can be selected at the moment."
"79","POSITIVE","Thank you, very much my opinion!
By the way, the FDP wanted to undo “Mövenpick” a little later, but the CSU, with which the FDP had put the matter on its way."
"80","NEGATIVE","In the last election, the green people received 5.2%. That was too much."
"81","NEGATIVE","Exactly 5.2 too much."
"82","NEGATIVE","The approval among the population, which is reflected in good polls...
The Greens did not receive 10% of votes in the last Bundestag election. There also no help (good? ) polls, whatever that means.
From the social market economy, the Greens are as far away as the sun to the moon!
The energy transition with its planned economy has already destroyed so much that if the unemployment figures are no longer covered, we will see the whole drama in the near future!
The Greens come as eco-fascists, and when they are in power, they will remove their green veil and further expand socialism. The word expropriation has already fallen, let's see what else they have on it!
Green away!!"
"83","NEUTRAL","“did not receive 10% of votes in the last Bundestag election.”

Have you ever seen news since the last election?

The fact that this election result is no longer representative, cannot be denied."
"84","NEUTRAL","Again and again photos on tabloid newspaper level. Who promotes this?"
"85","NEGATIVE","We had this in Germany before, that someone had announced what he had done before, even anyone who wanted to read that. After that, no one wanted to know anything...
If I look at what the Greens have been spreading over the last few days, then that is again the case, they say clearly what they want, everyone can read it, and afterwards it will be that no one wants to know anything. If there is a “afterman” then..."
"86","POSITIVE","You don't have to save anymore, I'll do it myself! 

At least it works."
"87","NEUTRAL","When does the Habeck era end? 
I thought that the green people only elect him and the chairman for two years."
"88","NEUTRAL","Then we see how a leprechaun turns into Vobalt, right?"
"89","POSITIVE","I hope he never becomes Chancellor. He can write children's books again, the little ones like fairy tales. And Mrs. Baerbock can play with her little goblins and store the electricity in the grid."
"90","POSITIVE","In fact, a new era will begin. I look forward to the Federal Chancellor Dr. Weidel and the Interior Minister Dr. Curio."
"91","POSITIVE","The perfect post for Dr. Curio. As Chancellor, I would rather see Meuthen, but I could also live well with pasture."
"92","POSITIVE","He probably means it begins the era of 5 -10%. I fully agree with him."
"93","NEUTRAL","On the word Era, Wiki tells us: “We are talking about a new era when a significant event or discovery or invention permanently changes the life of many or even all people. It usually involves a positive or neutral evaluation of this age.”

Given what many associate with the word era, one should use the word in conjunction with the Greens or Merkel very sparingly. That was twice ignored in the heading."
"94","POSITIVE","Very good. Thank you 👍"
"95","NEGATIVE","Don't panic, the hype of the Greens is certainly around. This is a self-confident cry of despair.
It would never have happened without Greta. Who knows who set up this girl and what the purpose of it is. The fact is that the hustle and bustle is failing.
I wish her to grow old without harm, she can't help it."
"96","NEGATIVE","There will be no green Chancellor. The Greta Hype has already settled down and in the polls the values of the undemocratic single theme and ban party have fallen from 25% to 18% at the moment, with a further decline. The next Chancellor is elected by a coalition of Union/AfD/FDP. Maybe it will be Friedrich Merz"
"97","NEUTRAL","The big “communicator” spoke!"
"98","NEUTRAL","What kind of herb did Mr. Habeck smoke again?"
"99","NEUTRAL","And if you think much worse it doesn't go anymore, come again the Greens with
Habeck and Baerbock. It's to run away!"
"100","NEGATIVE","Addendum: I'm going to leave this weekend for my health's sake
public coverage from the Green Party Congress in all media.
It's just too green for me and I run the risk of seeing red!"
"101","NEUTRAL","Pride comes before the fall."
"102","NEUTRAL","Habeck will be the next Vice-Chancellor and Finance Minister - and will then declare to everyone the commuter lump sum;)"
"103","NEGATIVE","Should he not do that gives a giant uprising"
"104","NEUTRAL","Yeah, yeah. The era of human beings is over. It begins the era of orcs."
"105","NEUTRAL","“The Merkel era is coming to an end. A new era begins”

Yes, exactly: the new Aera with the AfD and perhaps the FDP. The East shows us, and here in the West it is already beginning to bubble (I am currently experiencing live, freedom of expression is the topic in the countryside)."
"106","NEGATIVE","Those who choose red-red-green choose social injustice. The last red-green government has overthrown my old age plan because it has subsequently withdrawn my studies as a pensioner. Anyone who does this can't be social."
"107","NEUTRAL","CDU/CSU has improved what exactly about it in 14 years? Right, nothing!"
"108","NEGATIVE","The current policy has something of a Saturday night entertainment show where candidates have to draw cards and convince the audience of completely suspicious visions.

It's quite amusing what's going on if it didn't affect our country and our money.
I get to squint more and more on the calendar in the morning, so I would have dismissed many headlines as an April Fool.
Unbelievable what's being fabricated here. I can't imagine that all this is serious, almost all the theses are disproved.

I hope the show is over soon and there's already a plan to correct all the crap."
"109","NEUTRAL","From Merkel to Habeck - From the rain to the eaves."
"110","NEUTRAL","Or from diesel car to horse-drawn carriage 😜"
"111","NEGATIVE","This party is sinking and will fall behind the AfD at the federal level. I'm looking forward to it."
"112","NEUTRAL","After all, no one can say that he did not know how much the Greens wanted to change our society. A new era is to begin..."
"113","POSITIVE","Don't miss it now. Habeck's on the whole thing. He's got Chancellor in his head.

Too well formulated???"
"114","NEUTRAL","The Merkel era is coming to an end. What a news! Merkel himself has determined its end at the latest by the end of this legislative term in 2021! Habeck should explain how he envisages the economy in the future and who wants to finance the social achievements in the future."
"115","NEUTRAL","How he imagines the economy? 

Na with comfortable seating, shaky light and draught beer."
"116","NEUTRAL","And the observation by the protection of the Constitution can only be the first step - on the road to a ban on the AfD."
"117","NEGATIVE","A democratic party cannot be prohired."
"118","NEGATIVE","I find it very worrying about what's going on. It is not possible for one party to address the other and to make recommendations for surveillance to the security bodies. It's no longer democratic, it's more populist."
"119","POSITIVE","That's what it is. Seen a documentary on populism. Very well worth seeing. And revealing."
"120","NEGATIVE","Are elections again soon or what is the reinforcement of green advertising? How can you want to choose jmd who, according to his own statement, can not do anything with Germany!? Unless you want Germany to disappear."
"121","NEGATIVE","That's a sad thing."
"122","NEUTRAL","The observation of which party through the protection of the Constitution should be governed by the protection of the Constitution itself. My opinion is, however, who runs behind banners who say “Never again Germany” should be observed."
"123","NEUTRAL","Also a party leader who toying with a political system ala China should be observed."
"124","NEGATIVE","On the one hand, it is regrettable that an air tax, etc., is ripping off the citizen.
On the other hand, citizens will also have a different look at green policy through the high additional costs.
I dare to predict that the Greens will again be just below 10% shortly before the next BT election, where they belong."
"125","POSITIVE","... better still under 5%."
"126","NEUTRAL","“The Merkel era is coming to an end. A new era begins”

Actually, it can only get better."
"127","NEUTRAL","Better to use a long-sleeved philosopher without professional grounding 🤔"
"128","NEUTRAL","Habeck clearly positions itself as a candidate for chancellor.
And if you look at the current electoral behaviour, it could even happen if he forges the right alliances. 
I fear some of the local “Merkel must go!” Callers will then wish back the Mutti-Times eagerly. And Germany is ready."
"129","MIXED","No, if it goes wrong, at least those in office and dignship according to whose script everything is going on here."
"130","NEGATIVE","If one political provider calls for the ban on the other, it seems that he does not dare to compete!"
"131","NEGATIVE","In the book of books it is already written:
“You should not give up with unteachable, unthoughtful people.”
Do you fall under Habeck + Berbock?"
"132","NEUTRAL","With the GREEN I always do a thought experiment: the GREEN as the only party in Germany. Then how would the country look at? This shows me what crude views this party has."
"133","NEUTRAL","Bielefeld. The white green man has spoken:
The time has come to think the big things in Germany
Making a reality out of hope
A Policy of Enabling - Enabling Policy
say what's possible:
“It's exciting that Austria is probably getting a black-green government and is ahead of us.
“Dare more so not to risk everything”
Robert Habeck has declared the Chancellor's time ended
But nothing else new in the green. Only Annalena was missing."
"134","NEUTRAL","Annalena is looking for her goblins 🤓"
"135","NEUTRAL","“The Merkel era is coming to an end!”. -A new era begins!”. One can only hope that it will not be the 'era of Habeck'!!"
"136","NEGATIVE","I forbid Mr Habeck from now on!"
"137","NEGATIVE","The Greens have become too left to me and a bit too radical to choose them."
"138","NEUTRAL","Think of the origin of the “Greens”. They've always been radical!"
"139","NEGATIVE","The vision of a Mr. Habeck for Germany - a Chinese communism as a state form with him as a dictator, eh chancellor. God forbid!"
"140","NEGATIVE","In order to make a “green vision” feasible, Chinese communism as a form of society in Germany or whatever this country is supposed to be called (proposal from Mr. Habeck at Precht). Save yourself who can still!"
"141","POSITIVE","Only when she is no longer Chancellor will we know what we had about Mrs Merkel. I always laughed at this sentence. But when ixh sees the figures that are in the starting blocks to inherit them, I think about it."
"142","NEGATIVE","What is this derogatory talk of “creatures?” Can't you express yourself sensibly? Or I'll start thinking about it."
