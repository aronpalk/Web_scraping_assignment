"1","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúLashet would be a candidate for Jamaica‚Äù. 

From me, he can run in Jamaica! üòÇ"
"2","POSITIVE","Lashet? Jamaica? I think it's good. If he stays there, I'll pay the flight."
"3","POSITIVE","I can imagine Mr Laschet in all the coalitions, because he is very volatile!"
"4","NEUTRAL","Let's not be true, let's get from the rain into the eaves! Don't get anything baked here in North Rhine-Westphalia"
"5","NEGATIVE","Laschet is nothing more than a male Merkel. Nothing would change, but he doesn't seem as incompetent as AKK. A change cannot be brought about in this way."
"6","NEGATIVE","Lashet. Maybe it's good for Carnival Prince. But that's it. Casserted incompetence in all important issues, such as energy and migration policy, digitalisation, justice reform and internal security, the environment. Please, not this loser."
"7","NEUTRAL","If Laschet comes, the system remains Merkel and goes Germany before the dogs!
It's that simple!"
"8","POSITIVE","Laschet stands out only because of his beautifully worn cufflinks..."
"9","NEGATIVE","Lascher Chancellor? No, and 1000 times no. What can he, besides making beautiful speeches, evaluate with a lot of gestures and master theses that he has not read, but collect (Aachener TH). No charisma! Predestined as a CDU candidate? No, no, no, no, no."
"10","NEUTRAL","Mr. Laschet should rather take care of NRW... roads, hospitals, kindergartens, schools, etc. make new jobs Germany lucrative for investors...!"
"11","NEUTRAL","How about Mr. Frigelj, before you post new articles online, edit and release the comments on your last ‚ÄúGangbangs‚Äù. There must be several obstacles. Otherwise, you can turn off the comment feature in your articles, saving everyone involved time."
"12","NEUTRAL","That's true, Mr Laschet would be a candidate for Jamaica. However, I want a candidate for Germany. I hope that the FDP will remain steadfast and the CDU will set up a candidate who will clearly position itself against green socialism. That would be a miracle, but otherwise this party died for me too."
"13","NEUTRAL","I haven't believed in Wundrr for a long time"
"14","NEGATIVE","Completely overestimated and almost unknown. Merz has to do it now and not until 2021."
"15","NEUTRAL","He prevented RRG in North Rhine-Westphalia, but that is also his only merit. In the two and a half years he or his government did not succeed. North Rhine-Westphalia is becoming increasingly decaying. There must be a strong CDU candidate who can defeat the Dachelblick-Habeck with competence."
"16","NEUTRAL","That is why Laschet will succeed R√ºttger in full: no re-election in North Rhine-Westphalia and disappear in nowhere."
"17","NEGATIVE","Laschet is colorless, saying nothing, without contours. We've had enough of this kind of politician and I'm sick of it."
"18","NEUTRAL","Armin Laschet is just as unpopular as AKK. According to polls and rightly so, I think. As a reminder, his strongest argument in North Rhine-Westphalia was ‚Äúred-green-preventing‚Äù."
"19","POSITIVE","Laschet is a Merkel-Claqueur and thus this CDU policy, which is insolvent in terms of content, continues. That would be a blessing for the AfD, which would continue to benefit. AKK would also be great, only Merz could bring back some conservative voters. Because of the massive violations of this government, they will never regain my voice and that of my friends and acquaintances."
"20","NEUTRAL","I have also chosen the CDU all my life. I'll never vote for her again."
"21","NEUTRAL","With such a colorless Claqueur Merkelscher policy, the CDU would have an opportunist as chancellor candidate, who has what it takes to deepen the alienation of this party from its old regular electorate."
"22","POSITIVE","Strongly formulated!"
"23","NEUTRAL","I'm sure he wouldn't get my voice. But since only the party stands for election and the BK is elected by the Bundestag, this will only be what if the parties move further towards the Unity Party."
"24","NEUTRAL","Laschet would be Merkel 2.0!"
"25","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúLaschet pursues his own political agenda,‚Äù said Markus S√∂der fortunately, and this was much better than Anne Will did."
"26","MIXED","Mr. Laschet is like AKK, but his words are turned a little more elegantly. But he will not change any more than AKK. If he becomes a chancellor candidate, the CDU will be as lost as with The current Chairman..."
"27","NEUTRAL","... after this Bielefeld Party Congress of the Greens, there can only be a Jamaica coalition if
a) Mr Lindner or the FDP raises their (legitimate) grounds for refusal, as after the last Bundestag election,... and
(b) if Mr Lascher is satisfied with the position of the Vice-Chancellor.
If it comes to that... poor Germany"
"28","NEGATIVE","Laschet owes his post solely to the inability of the SPD. Now he is suddenly chosen by the media as chancellor candidate. He certainly owes this to his network and not to the quality of his work. The CDU needs a chancellor candidate of personality and can speak clear words and not an opportunist who then secretly pulls his strings in the background."
"29","POSITIVE","Nothing ‚Äúinspires‚Äù me when I hear that name... on the contrary. He stands for a clear both and. We already have sufficient numbers of politicians of this kind."
"30","NEUTRAL","2.5 years of Prime Minister in North Rhine-Westphalia do not qualify anyone for the Chancellery."
"31","NEUTRAL","Anything, but not Laschet!"
"32","NEGATIVE","sorry, with me nothing is ‚Äúinspired‚Äù except fear"
"33","POSITIVE","And then I was spontaneously happy with the title... someone emigrates to the Caribbean."
"34","NEGATIVE","Big sayings, nothing behind it! This is Armin Laschet. I recall his criticism of the DUH (Deutsche Umwelt Hilfe), responsible for warning terror and abstruse demands in the sense of fine dust on our roads, in our everyday work. Laschet mutatis mutandis, that DUH should be abolished if it negatively affects our lives.
What happened to it? None! 
A real ‚Äúlashet‚Äù!"
"35","NEGATIVE",">> ‚ÄúThis is a normal party congress. What is going to happen,‚Äù said the 58-year-old with almost irritating innocence at a press conference last Wednesday in the Landtag. ‚ÄúYou just don't want to see this form of insincerity anymore."
"36","NEUTRAL","Laschet as chancellor candidate means Habeck as chancellor.

They still manage to vote on the right in the waistband!"
"37","NEUTRAL","Laschet would be the candidate for Jamaica? Right, let him go to Jamaica and all right! Laschet stands for this. That won't bring back voters from the AFD. The decline of the CDU would continue, but that's what the media want. Jamaka under green leadership! A creepy idea for this country! If you want to follow the path of the SPD, you should bet on Laschet and Comrade Guenter, the two biggest fans of Mama Merkel"
"38","NEGATIVE","The CDU (i.e. Merkel) has already made a (further) serious mistake with the installation of AKK, the effects of which are not yet recognized, but will soon fly around our ears.
Mr Laschet also suffers from grandiose self-overestimation and his supporters from company blindness. Only when the CDU has arrived at the very bottom there will be a new beginning.
So forward - down!"
"39","NEUTRAL","No, he would only be ideal if you wanted to press the voices for the CDU. With Merz, the CDU would drive significantly better."
"40","NEUTRAL","Prime Minister Armin Laschet should first bake small rolls and put NRW in order before he can only think about bigger tasks. In North Rhine-Westphalia there is still enough to do for him. It is never good if the eyes are bigger than the mouth because you can swallow it if the bite is too big."
"41","NEUTRAL","Please keep in mind that NRW has been an SPD country with very few exceptions since the war, with the full programme. When schools, offices, councilors have been occupied for decades by mostly social democratic staff, it is infinitely difficult to change mentalities. One must acknowledge that Laschet is doing very skillful, not pushing everyone in front of his head, but trying to take them with him. That's why he should stay in North Rhine-Westphalia. I fear that, as Chancellor, he will not be able to set the necessary course."
"42","NEGATIVE","According to forecasts, only one chancellor candidate Laschet Jamaica would not have a majority... CDU/CSU would be 24%, almost the worst, with AFD going up to almost 20%. That would look much better with Merz."
"43","NEGATIVE","If it continues, you will soon only be able to read the NZZ."
"44","POSITIVE","R. Ma√ßon:
I thought it was entertaining. You're right about the NZZ. I also have the online edition on my subscription. The view from the outside is sometimes surprisingly different."
"45","NEUTRAL","Laschet would be the candidate for Jamaica -

However, let him go to Jamaica."
"46","NEUTRAL","Laschet stands for this.
That won't bring back voters from the AFD.
The decline of the CDU would continue."
"47","NEUTRAL","Laschet means old wine in new hoses. Austria has already proven that youth does not necessarily have to be an unvirtue in politics. Ibiza lurks everywhere in politics and should therefore not deterrent Span to throw his hat in the ring."
"48","NEUTRAL","I'm going to tap Laschet. It used to be said that you cannot become a chancellor without the backing of the newspaper. Today, I would say that you cannot become a chancellor without the support of public broadcasting. Laschet, through his charming, balanced way, manages to at least not be regarded as an enemy in left-green broadcasting. When they visit www.fotzenfritz.com in the browser, they see how popular Friedrich Merz is with extreme leftists. But Friedrich Merz is also combated by public broadcasting. There are always allusions to his age, although a Winfried Kretschmann is some years older. Theo Koll spoke on Sunday about a CDU St√∂ren-Friedrich Merz. A low point was the ZDF film ‚ÄúThe Candidat - How social is Friedrich Merz?‚Äù
https://www.zdf.de/politik/frontal-21/kandidat-friedrich-merz-100.html
At 6:50, a reporter follows Merz as if it were a criminal."
"49","NEGATIVE","Jens W.:
I think so. And at Friedrich Merz, our progressive forces are really tireless. Phobia? Probably pathological."
"50","POSITIVE","Laschet as prime minister in Jamaica, yes that would be really good üòä"
"51","NEUTRAL","Laschet as Chancellor with Lindner as Minister of Economy and Habeck as Minister of Finance and Vice-Chancellor.
This is the first step into fairytale land."
"52","NEGATIVE","And what exactly does Mr Laschet stand for? Actually, for nothing concrete. It would be further growled and talked to the cry necks after the mouth."
"53","MIXED","The Laschet scenario doesn't seem so unlikely to me. In the meantime, the AKK is likely to be almost excluded in view of the survey figures. If in just over a year it still has the worst survey scores of all eligible candidates, it must act in the spirit of the party and renounce it. Then Merz, Spahn and Laschet remain. Merz is likely to encounter the bitter resistance of the Merkel supporters and will therefore have it very difficult. Spahn is doing very decent work as a minister and is therefore quite conceivable from my point of view, but will always have to argue against the fact that he is still quite young. Laschet, on the other hand, is at the right age, has a strong domestic power with NRW and is something like the personalized compromise."
"54","NEUTRAL","Bosbach won the NRW election.
Not Mr. Laschet.

The unprofiled Mr. Laschet alone had a good chance to lose even against a grottenbad SPD, embodied in the person of Mrs. Kraft. 

Seen from a distance, it is a mouthpiece for others in federal politics. When times change, it also serves others. He believes he can wait in the background until the heavyweights have mutually neutralized.

That's why he's not a leader to me. I prefer those with an open visor. 

But perhaps I am wrong to Mr Laschet."
"55","NEUTRAL","Paint must test... give him something to correct..."
"56","NEUTRAL","... litmus test..."
"57","NEUTRAL","I don't know why the prospect of Laschet's chancellor is supposed to inspire any fantasies. For me, that would be horror fantasies if at all. If Laschet was to become a chancellor candidate, it would only strengthen the margins - something politicians always pretend to want to fight. After all, if four very similar parties with a barely distinguishable left-liberal oversupply turn to the voters, the remaining conservatives in the CDU, will move to the AfD or to the camp of non-voters. The AfD will then relatively quickly become a party that will no longer pass by. I do not understand why this very easy to understand circumstance is still not seen by a significant group in the CDU, why you want to take the wrong path over and over again. I can only give the CDU an honest advice: don't do that! Otherwise you will follow the path of the SPD at the latest."
"58","NEGATIVE","Mr Laschet would fully assume Mrs Merkel's political objectives. For this reason, he is intolerable as a candidate for chancellor. Unless the CDU does not want to participate in the political stage in the future..."
"59","NEGATIVE","There are always absurd ideas...!"
"60","NEUTRAL","Without Merz, no spring comes into the Union."
"61","NEUTRAL","AKK= absolutely no chancellor candidate, but Armin Laschet neither."
"62","NEUTRAL","I am NRW'ler at the southernmost point of the country and would like to have the RLP border 4 km closer. For me, Laschet embodies the cheerful All&Nothing politician. He wanted to become an honorary professor at the venerable RWTH Aachen. But he busted the exams and then gave good grades hands-free. This is not good for the Rhenish Carnival, however, for a chancellor candidacy. Please, don't. This country can withstand a lot - but Laschet as Chancellor rather not!"
"63","NEGATIVE","Laschet would be no surprise with the pathetic staff of the CVDU/CSU. With the 1000 permanent claps, he would have guaranteed support, because this would stand just like Merkel for everything or nothing, depending on the wind direction. As a result, the differences from the SPD are no longer visible. So transport can only do good to our country if the present incapable felt makes itself even more noticeable by Laschet and then finally ends."
"64","NEUTRAL","If Mr Laschet is the lowest common denominator on which the CDU can agree with the CSU on the question of chancellor candidacy, it is going, as with a chancellor candidate AKK, towards a coalition with the Greens and the Left Party.
Just as the Berlin Federal CDU conveys her self-image, she is right at the moment, the main thing is that she remains in power and places the chancellor candidate. But that would be the way the SPD has already gone and the way to not only stabilize an AfD, but also continue to feed it. Laschet or AKK as the last conservative reserve of the CDU, that would be a feast for the rulers to the right of the CDU/CSU. This would mean that the AfD would have reached the Federal Council for a short or long time."
"65","NEGATIVE","Laschet is an opportunist and windshadowdriver, but certainly not a conservative politician and even less someone with brave ideas. Just because he has the charisma of a cosy pub owner does not make him a better alternative to Merz, Spahn or S√∂der for an equally confusing and conceptual country. This male Merkel would bore the country to death. Sorry, but NRW is just not a seal of approval right now. Bavaria does."
"66","NEUTRAL","S√∂der is probably the greatest opportunist, he can turn his flag to the wind so fast when it comes to his career. He doesn't care about the principles of a reliable policy. Just like the party, voters or Bavaria. The main thing is that they serve as stirrup holders on the way to Berlin. The bees say hello.
Let's see how the CSU performs in local elections. Many local politicians will probably be sacrificed for their boss's unprincipled career spaces."
"67","NEGATIVE","I have already written several times, but I would like to repeat it again: Laschet is a political joke figure.
His coalition depends on a majority vote, even because the Left Party failed very close to the 5% hurdle - against a completely dismantled force with the security risk of hunters as Minister of the Interior. According to polls, the majority has long since escaped far away.
Laschet was only second choice in his national association. He has suffered several serious defeats in his party (chauder deposition and non-nomination of Brok as a member of the EU), with the majority of his district chairmen already opposed him. In a party like the CDU, such a thing is so rare, as head of the country, he would be ready to resignation after such an action if he were not prime minister.
As head of government, he has not proven himself. For decades, it was a great practice to take Prime Minister seriously only after a successful reelection. Laschet is talking only because there are virtually no such prime ministers in the Union. Also applies to S√∂der. In fact, Haseloff from Saxony-Anhalt should most likely be a heavyweight, but he has managed to re-election with deviations from Merkel's course and is therefore not mediable in the CDU. or. AKK was such a heavyweight until she dwarved herself."
"68","NEGATIVE","Laschet as chancellor? Then the CDU follows the SPD. Laschet is non-binding, not visionary and just as slow as Merkel now. 
What comes from him at the moment that you want at the federal level?"
"69","NEGATIVE","In addition, he is unsymphatic and comes very ‚Äúgreasy‚Äù over."
"70","NEUTRAL","Laschet leads AfD to 20%"
"71","POSITIVE","Well over 20%."
"72","NEUTRAL","Seriously now? The NRW election was won by Rot-Gr√ºn's catastrophic school policy. Laschet is and remains a more or less Symath provincial politician."
"73","NEUTRAL","Laschet is the Andrea Nahles of the CDU."
"74","POSITIVE","In fact, despite Mr Laschet, the CDU won in North Rhine-Westphalia. To attribute this merit to Mr Laschet is already strong. The SPD managed to do that. And now considering Mr Laschet as chancellor candidate is a testimony of poverty. A contour, permanent, everything and every understanding politician without corners and edges who overestimate each other. With it, the CDU follows the SPD towards 5%."
"75","POSITIVE","Mr. Laschet belongs to the left wing within the CDU. While it fits better with the Greens, conservative voters would rather move away who do not want a coalition with the Greens. That drives many voters to the right. Laschet's statements on more climate protection and positive statements about the Greens no longer bring CDU voters ‚Äî these people choose the original: The Greens!
As a chancellor candidate, Laschet would strengthen the margins and weaken the CDU."
"76","NEUTRAL","Laschet as Chancellor candidate, Martin Schulz of the Union. You can only take that with humor. What is the target? 15%?"
"77","NEUTRAL","According to the motto: What the SPD can do, we have been able to do for a long time."
"78","NEUTRAL","The probability is high that the government coalition will include green and black after the next election - in which order is still open. It would not be possible that the Greens vote in Merz, if he becomes the CDU chancellor candidate, if necessary, is far from being determined. 

Laschet would be much more compatible. And it is precisely that Laschet's non-binding nature that I disagreed with. With everything a bit for it, a bit about it, don't hurt anybody, but you don't know."
"79","POSITIVE","I guess it's going on with all the plums."
"80","POSITIVE","How right you are!"
"81","POSITIVE","What he said about nuclear power, I think it's right. If they weren't shut down, we'd have fewer problems."
"82","NEGATIVE","Nomen est omen; Let it Lashet. Anyone who seriously considers candidates like AKK or Laschet did not understand the seriousness of the democratic crisis in this country. Lukewarm pragmatic continuation so tactics no longer live up to this crisis. The voter wants real conservatives and edgy Social Democrats so that he can finally have another election."
"83","NEUTRAL","I'm still a voter! And for me, I say that I do not want angular Social Democrats - yes, preferably none, neither round nor square nor angular."
"84","NEUTRAL","If the CDU wants to become the junior partner of the Greens, it must set up precisely Mr Laschet. However, the force itself is only the third strongest."
"85","POSITIVE","@ Jost J. Thank you for your pinpoint analysis."
"86","NEUTRAL","Laschet as chancellor candidate?
Then the CDU continues downhill."
"87","POSITIVE","Laschet, God help us. This is Merkel 2.0 with a permanent smile! That's it with the CDU/CSU - if Mr. Laschet is set up. When will the CDU/CSU finally start hiring personalities with empathy on the free market? Headhunter is enough and hand Georg Maa√üen would be a name that also brings the conservative back into the boat!
With Laschet it continues downhill!"
"88","NEGATIVE","Lashet... God help us... This is Merkel 2.0! Far worse than AKK than new BK!"
"89","NEUTRAL","Laschet has underestimated one or the other. And today he is Prime Minister of the most populous federal state. And: He and his cabinet do the work very well, as polls confirm."
"90","NEUTRAL","According to a representative survey by n-tv and RTL, Laschet is one of the least popular prime ministers in Germany! He just reached 13th place (out of 16)."
"91","MIXED","I can't see that mischievous grin anymore. S√∂der would be a chancellor of format."
"92","NEGATIVE","S√∂der der der Beefriend-he has lost the bite and has a softened effect, and the worst: he is beating himself to the Greens. Does he have ambitions in the Cabinet of Habeck?"
"93","NEUTRAL","For me, Laschet wouldn't be an option, Merkel J√ºnger with the right name. Then a coalition with the Greens. No, thank you. The CDU wouldn't survive that."
"94","NEUTRAL","Well, if Mr Laschet is to become the number one of the CDU in terms of chancellor candidacy, then I can only say that my vote would not be the CDU. The right margin is crumbling dramatically away, and it is only scolded against it, the edge, rather than asking oneself to what extent a legal existence in the democratic debate has to show itself in terms of substance. Right, left: in the Anglo-Saxon world, it's the order of the day to speak right and left, for example, Tories and Labour Party. Right is never equated to right-wing radical, just as for left, that left did not mean ad hoc socialist or even further left (well, the Prime aspirant of the Labour Party is certainly a Marxist, but that's coincidence.) And Mr. Laschet ‚Äî as much as under whose authority the state of North Rhine-Westphalia may feel a bit better (especially back to G9 ‚Äî thank you!) ‚Äî is, in the meantime, the classic politician of equidistance, of non-determination. If I had to say it, so for a short time completely undemocratic, I would be ad hoc for F. Merz ‚Äî no matter whether cum-ex or his so-called wealth (he worked hard and earned a lot of money ‚Äî applause instead of envy would be appropriate). He would bring with him an angular profile that he would be a moderate right for me, a liberal-conservative politician who, with all his strength, was willing to defend what was also important to me: a right-wing state, which, bearing in mind the great separation of powers, would be a so-called good nationalism that would not be people, chauvinistic or otherwise abnormal; who would follow the idea of constitutional patriotism and act accordingly; and then ‚Äî hopefully ‚Äî on the example of the USA or Canada or New Zealand (I recommend researching how strict the admission criteria are in New Zealand) would turn D into an immigration country. For me, this would be modern and conservative and a counter-model to the world-mancipatory project of leftist provenance."
"95","POSITIVE","Reads well: -) not quite your opinion - but almost. Thank you for your detailed statement - I think so many think in and near the CDU/CSU."
"96","NEUTRAL","Wasn't Laschet the one who lost all exams after a seminar in Berlin and then let all students pass? It only came out because some students asked how to pass an exam they had not attended. Hihi... But things like this haven't hurt in Germany for a long time, since he has already become prime minister."
"97","POSITIVE","Mr. Latschet ‚Äúinspires the fantasies‚Äù.. - so please! Which one? (I prefer not to describe my..).
I think this is like wine.. - simple land red should be consumed quickly, it definitely does not get better in old age.., and at some point you can not even process it into vinegar anymore.."
"98","NEGATIVE","The CDU urgently needs a fresh start with people who are able to rebuild trust. 
Especially since the migration crisis is still not really coped.
Mr. Laschet has always been deaf and uncontoured on Merkel course. With him, at least from my point of view, a new beginning is not possible!"
"99","NEUTRAL","For the next Union chancellor candidate, the Greens will be the only coalition partner offering (because of the AFD of Vornein exclusititis). The Greens will enter negotiations with maximum demands. If Laschet, AKK or G√ºnther sit on the other side, the Greens will enforce 99% of their demands - Merz, Spahn or S√∂der ‚Äúonly‚Äù 90%."
"100","NEUTRAL","I hope Merz won't be so corrupted. Apart from that, Merz will achieve a better result for the CDU than in the last Bundestag election, he is able to dare a minority government. It would be a risk, but someone who worked in the economy can handle it."
"101","NEGATIVE","I'd rather have a Friedrich Merz. You can think of him whatever you want. But in his career after retirement in 2009, he seems to me like someone who is sovereign and does not do it, because he doesn't have a job, but because he wants to advance the country. Moreover, I think he is intellect light years away from what many other politicians so offer us."
"102","NEUTRAL","Marcel B., unfortunately Friedrich ‚Äúthe Great‚Äù is not considered as chancellor candidate for the CDU, dwarves do not like giants!"
"103","NEGATIVE","God forbid. 

That's it with the CDU/CSU - if Mr. Laschet is set up. When will the CDU/CSU finally start hiring personalities with empathy on the free market? Headhunter is enough. The Greens are at the forefront because they have succeeded in bringing two quasi highflyer to the fore.

If the AFD succeeded (Gauland away) then this party would go through the ceiling."
"104","NEGATIVE","And especially H√∂cke off!!! And his same."
"105","NEUTRAL","Please, not one of Merkel's upper gossip rabbits!"
"106","NEGATIVE","One can only hope for Germany that this will not happen."
"107","NEGATIVE","The green tie in the picture above fits perfectly with Mr Laschet as chancellor candidate in a possible black-and-green coalition 2021.

That would be exactly his thing.

I can't understand his alleged popularity values. Obviously, the people surveyed have not realised that Mr Laschet is a flawless opportunist and Merkel-Lemming, who is very far left."
"108","NEUTRAL","Very far left? I think it's only on the left because Mrs Merkel says there. For me, Mr Laschet is the upper clap rabbit, without a backbone and without his own opinion. A Merkel opportunist as he is in the book. I know from many old CDU members that this gentleman at the head of the party or the state itself would be a reason for them to finally turn their backs on this former party."
