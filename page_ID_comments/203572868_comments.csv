"1","NEUTRAL","“Thirdly, Macron sees with unrest that NATO resources are currently not focused on West Africa, but on Poland and the Baltic against Russia. “
Does Mr Macron know that Poland and the Baltic States are Nato members and that West Africa is not? What is Nato doing there? Is there a duty to provide assistance?"
"2","NEGATIVE","Where and when in the world has intervening military pacified anything sustainably? After reading, it remains with me: the puzzle games are only suitable for redividing the world, so as not to lose access to raw materials. Even if the crisis belt leads from Libya to Nigeria and forms terrorist flocks there, the march of foreign military forces does not lead to the minimization of terror units there, but to the contrary."
