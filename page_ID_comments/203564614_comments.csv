"1","MIXED","The problem is that most politicians do not have close expertise. Unfortunately, even the least of them have ever worked in the free economy. If ideological bornness is added, the chaos is perfect.

Without a flourishing economy and a very busy labour market, no tax revenue will be generated. But this simple basic understanding is missing from many completely."
"2","NEGATIVE","That this government and politicians are more likely to violate the GG has been known since 2015, but unfortunately the illegal action remains without consequences"
"3","NEUTRAL","Parts of the Berlin Senate think of themselves in the purest socialism. You can quickly be guided by your ideology."
"4","NEUTRAL","For me, the only relevant question: Which federal state dares to finally turn off the financial tap in the context of the Länder Finanzeeequalisation of the Bötländer Republik Berlin? The communist fluidity and laziness of the Berlin Senate are boundless and far from the end. As long as the money bubbles, this spook will not end - worn by voters who have nothing to do with value creation and diligence."
"5","NEGATIVE","Sorry but here in the Ländle it is no different. Just don't get so publicly. Our station here is devouring such sums. Not solemn anymore. Politics have lost any relation to reality wherever you look. If a small entrepreneur allows himself to make a tiny mistake, he will pay for it dearly. There is thought about the duty to master craftsmanship. Only in politics where a “mastery duty” would be appropriate. There's no such thing"
"6","NEUTRAL","In Berlin, many things violate the Basic Law. For example, the “right to physical integrity” is highly endangered if you are a taxpayer and move to a residential area dominated by the squatter scene or rented there, attracting attention. For the left-anarchists, an apartment that has a better standard than a downed ruin or costs a little more than nothing, and you as a “capitalist” are physically extremely endangered."
"7","POSITIVE","What excites me most is the unprecedented amount of money being squandered right now. Courts and theater for nothing and again nothing. More and more often we see that any strange things are being passed. The administrative apparatus immense. All the costs that are paid on our backs. Be it tolls, rental covers, airports, unthought-out large-scale construction sites. You can expect that before you make something, the whole thing is tested and thought out. No, instead of cost more and more. When I do a job like our politicians as a worker, I get rid of my job. But here we are pushed and sounded, this is no longer solemn. All the humbuck that the gentlemen have screwed up in the last three years alone. That would have been billions of relief. Instead, it could have been taken care of. That the payroll bag is not ripped like that. Then we can afford to live again."
"8","NEUTRAL","Yeah, that's how ideology dictates politics. The Red-Red-Greens want to implement their socialist (nightmares) dreams in Berlin - and they quickly get together with the rule of law. On the basis of this example, one can clearly see what constitutes the quality of the rule of law, among other things: it compares the interests of different groups and then pours this consensus into the form of law. Politics with the crowbar (in this case GDR style) immediately violates the rights and interests of some parties involved in the overall process. Have fun turning up the shard pimp! 
Oh yes, was it not a Berlin government that consisted of two of the three current government partners, which, in the last decade, has wasted thousands of social housing belonging to the Land of Berlin to investor groups? My dear husband - the Red ones in Berlin are really on it. First they make one on turbo capitalist and shamelessly shamelessly shelling valuable public possessions (almost without getting red) and now they are making a 180 degree turn and use socialist fantasies of expropriation. Even if the ruling mayor was still called differently in the era of worsening - a political course that can be trusted looks different."
"9","NEUTRAL","Now it's not just the Berlin government that rules past its citizens. Hardly one does it differently. And also those who are not ruled red or green."
"10","NEGATIVE","“Berlin rental cover should violate the Basic Law”

Did anybody seriously think it wasn't like that?"
"11","NEUTRAL","If that were the case, it would certainly have been in the way of finding this “fact”. Enough lead time was available, the promotion was announced long enough. 

In return, however, as a European group, I would consider who would be the beneficiary at the end of the day if the competence of the country can be thrown over with supposedly functioning federal norms?
I mean, there was a historical event that ensured that federal independence had entered our GG."
"12","NEUTRAL","If the law actually turns out to be unconstitutional and additional payments should be due, then who pays? The tenants, the city or the taxpayers of Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg, Hesse and Hamburg via the state financial compensation."
"13","NEUTRAL","It is written in the text: 
If only later a court would tilt the rental cover, “chaos” would be threatened. The tenants would pay a large amount of additional payments."
"14","NEGATIVE","Well, nothing else could come out of a troupe of unsuspecting and dropout. The wasted hours these people were supposed to be working in a volunteer service. I call this kind of working time fraud because it was already foreseeable before that it was pointless."
"15","NEUTRAL","If the Berlin Senate does not get the lease cover in a democracy, they will probably switch to socialism in Berlin. Then it works."
"16","NEUTRAL","That's what lawyers explain right from the beginning."
"17","NEUTRAL","Finally something sensible from Seehofer"
"18","POSITIVE","Oh, Gottchen, the CSU rubs on Berlin, that can be cheerful.
I'll get the popcorn."
"19","NEGATIVE","“The draft law implies the freedom of ownership of the apartment owners, according to the mail, which was sent on 31 October.” 
Yes, that doesn't matter R2G - that's the thoughts of the Socialists. 
Even worse, R2G enacted unconstitutional laws - this would have to be observed by the protection of the Constitution, if you take it very carefully. 
I find the whole left-wing political situation in Germany only counterproductive and ill. What kind of heads govern our country?"
"20","NEUTRAL","And Seehofer's party should then be observed because of the Scheuerschen toll campaign or Christian Schmidt's glyphosate approval."
"21","NEGATIVE","“Already now, the proposed law is damaging because rents are increased and refurbishments are postponed.”

And that's just the beginning. Nobody or very few will be rented apartments building welce. Apartment which are currently rented, then sold to people who want to live in it themselves. So the offer of rental apartments in Berlin is getting scarce."
"22","NEUTRAL","Berlin could prosper like Singapore. Instead, the Berlin left will tear the whole country into the abyss!"
"23","NEUTRAL","I didn't expect anything else from our expensive players.
Or should one say amateurs?"
"24","NEGATIVE","The high rents are stylized into a conflict between good and evil, from west and east or from poor and rich.

None of this is true. Rather, rents in cities are the result of a failed policy. 

First, social housing is sold to fill the grim coffers, then they are raised almost 100%. 

The requirements for energy standards or barrier-free apartments (elevator systems) are increasingly exacerbated and conversions are only approved if thousands of specifications are met and possibly very expensive modifications are implemented additionally. 

An example. Water heating must no longer be done centrally - as in many houses for 70-80 years. But now Legionella can arise when the water is in the pipeline. Means the warm water is treated decentrally. 

This costs approx. 2,000 EUR per apartment (technology). The technique lasts 20 years alone this costs almost 9 EUR per apartment per month. Even more extreme is when building new - one square meter costs at least 2,500 EUR under construction. After 25 years, the point should come at which this is again “in”. Therefore, EUR 8.33 per month (net) must be spent on this alone. Now the landlord has to tax the income. On the one hand, he may write off the 4.17 EUR per square metre, but counts at least 2.50 EUR tax per square metre.

Under 10 EUR/m2, nothing runs.

As a result of this failed policy, rents are rising. And then the landlords who rent apartments to improve their pensions or invest assets will be punished and virtually expropriated. 

That's wrong. It's just wrong. And if the Constitutional Court sees it that way, I still have hope for the country. The problems have to be solved differently. Higher housing allowance, better depreciation (degressively for new buildings).

The refugees, too, could have been spread over the area rather than further burdening the tense rental markets of the cities."
"25","POSITIVE","I'm very curious how this ends. My trust in the court suffered badly (see decisions on nuclear phase-out, etc.). Sometimes you get the impression that you are talking to the government side so that you may not be able to make negative effects on politics too violent. I become thoughtful when I hear that the government is delighted with “legal clarity” or similar formulations. The Court seems to have become more and more a political decision-making body, which also likes to take politics before it."
"26","NEUTRAL","What interests the Central Committee of the SED (alias “The Left”) the GG. Mrs Lompscher is still deeply in her Eastern Zone mentality and apparently feels obliged to complete the take-over of West Berlin into the Communist sphere of influence. The missing 24 billion Ostmark would of course help to eliminate the housing problem. Perhaps D. Bartsch knows more about the whereabouts of this enormous sum. To me, these are all hypocrites and populists. However, even worse, Berliners who choose such people."
"27","NEUTRAL","Populists never think from the end. 
This includes the Berlin Senate!"
"28","NEUTRAL","@ H. S.
I just keep hearing and reading the AFD would be poplists, what now?"
"29","NEUTRAL","Well, that's how you do it with the left, enact laws that violate the Basic Law. Groko has just done something similar, with the incomplete abolition of Solis as a crippled rich tax, which will also be shot down in court."
"30","POSITIVE","Oh, what, the soloist fits perfectly into the concept of the BGH."
"31","NEUTRAL","Violation of the GG? Because of final federal regulation? - And then the lawyers check the individual points of the rent cap? - So the lawyers are suddenly not sure whether there is a violation of the GG by state legislation, since then a substantive examination is not required. 2 lawyers, 3 opinions. We are curious to see what courts and thus real lawyers think of the regulation."
"32","NEUTRAL","Without validity, the GG is not
is more valid, so no law can violate it either."
"33","NEUTRAL","Mrs Lompscher intentionally produces laws that are against the Constitution. According to Robert Habeck, this should be forbidden? It's part of freedom."
"34","NEGATIVE","But, of course, the decades-long too ridicular rents did not violate the Basic Law. The Basic Law applies only to the rich and..."
"35","NEUTRAL","Rich people pay higher rents than poor people or what is it about? And when is a rent “too high”?"
"36","NEUTRAL","Oh CDU CSU,
I want someone to be interested in.
How was that on the toll?
The CDU CSU represents the interests of the corporations is clear to everyone.
If they've ever done something for the people, don't waste."
"37","NEUTRAL","Dear Huber,
just come to Bavaria and look at a CSU ruled country close by.
Please remove the glasses beforehand"
"38","NEGATIVE","And I bet the same people who are upset about Scheurer's toll contracts are hiring all the people who are supposed to monitor the rental cover, and then they are quite surprised when it is picked up by the BVG."
"39","NEUTRAL","and that's only noticeable now?"
"40","NEGATIVE","Berliner rental cover should violate the Basic Law. Emphasis is on shoul. na, where are the eggs of the cdu? Come on, complain. Smile."
"41","NEGATIVE","Why “cdu”? First and foremost, it's the precautionary person. And I'm sure someone will bite back when he's brought to his retirement improvement."
"42","NEUTRAL","In Berlin, apparently, things are now being passed more often that are unconstitutional. Well, the laws don't apply the same to everyone."
"43","NEGATIVE","There is no need to be an “expert” or similar to see that a rental cover is not conforming to the Constitution. Well, with similar “no-brainers”, the Constitutional Court, which complies with the merkely-compliant, also surprised (unpleasant)."
"44","NEUTRAL","Which constitution DE has no, and unfortunately the GG does not apply anywhere anymore. Was deleted in 1991 the period of validity paragraph."
"45","POSITIVE","The solution to the housing shortage is very simple. Only nobody wants to know that. Ask Mrs. Merkel. She wanted to do it."
"46","NEGATIVE","Oh, come on. Either way, the left have already won. If the lid comes, they are the heroes (for their clientele), the lid does not come (in the form), they have at least tried it and can unload the fault of failure in the SPD, the covenant or simply “the system”. It should be clear to everyone that this is not about a solution to the lack of housing. The theme can be used too wonderfully to fuel the class struggle."
"47","NEUTRAL","Supplement: If the lid turns out to be a big mistake later, then some of market failures will be condemned and expropriations will be demanded."
"48","NEGATIVE","If the rental cover is tilted later, the tenants will be subject to high demands. If there are more than two months old rent, probably only a good relationship with the landlord will help against a notice without notice. I do not think that the Berlin Senate will be able to deal with these individual cases, let alone, to provide a quick remedy, if it wants."
"49","NEGATIVE","Ever tried to get a tenant out of an apartment? You need a lot of time and money to get rid of it. If he doesn't pay this is a problem for the landlord and in the end a judge decides for the tenant anyway."
"50","NEGATIVE","If that's true, the RRG Berlin Senate has once again embarrassed itself badly."
"51","NEGATIVE","Try and Error politics is obviously the new style, and our unfortunately anything but independent Federal Constitutional Court waves some errors."
"52","NEUTRAL","Let's see when the laws on the election of the Berlin House of Deputies will be changed?
The parties united in the National Front had to adhere to a distribution key. How the look determined the SED (probably called LINKE today).
Which self-employed are the next victims of socialist politics? The bakers? The price of 1.05 for the double-baked bread? Compulsory loans for Forced Managed Houses where the owners could not afford to carry out modernization and conservation measures?
The result - the KWV sat (perhaps the Socialists do not even have the ingenuity to rename this old institution) on too few, too broken apartments.
The fault was capitalism. 
Keep fighting dear comrades on the Berlin property front."
"53","NEUTRAL","Thank you Berlin! Investors' money goes elsewhere where where I benefit from rising real estate prices."
"54","NEGATIVE","People with little money put on the street against what vests that?"
"55","NEGATIVE","You have the right of freedom of establishment, no one MUST live in the city!"
"56","POSITIVE","Legislation according to the “Trial and Error” procedure? Congratulations!"
"57","NEUTRAL","I am in favour of the Berliners being allowed to keep their lid! We can throw them out of the covenant for that. They can then set up their own state. To protect themselves from us, they can build a wall! The Wall Shooter Party is already involved in the government; they know how to do this!"
"58","NEGATIVE","Merkel and her federal government must also be blamed for this negative development - namely the decision of apparently unconstitutional laws or unconstitutional political action in general. That this school does when it is practiced carelessly over and over again, one must not be surprised."
"59","NEUTRAL","Habeck wants to enforce it all over Germany, were his words, so why still upset about Berlin, it is so wanted by politics. The economic power Germany should no longer exist, welcome to the site where no one should have money but everyone wants more and more.
Finally, it can't work, but what do I know?"
"60","NEUTRAL","What exactly does it have to do with the German economy when foreign investors, for example, from China, enter the German real estate market and are only looking for bushing money? 
Do you know the conditions on the real estate market in Berlin? You are right, this is no longer about the tenant, but only about full pockets for as little consideration as possible, that is, money! Housing must remain affordable, but in many places he is no longer. If you think that in Berlin's city centre, Tiergarten district, less than 40 square meters are offered for over 1000 euros, you are touching your head. And this isn't even a special area! This is justified by the statement, government district. But in these areas of the district, is not much noticeable from the government district. And if you then have problems in such living spaces, which the landlord would have to eliminate, you run spit rods and can no longer do without legal support. Let alone, without tedious and unnecessary processes! This is the reality in the Berlin real estate market in the area of private rental goods. See the unilateral..."
"61","MIXED","Welcome to Germany.
Nobody knows anything. All arbitrariness.

"62","NEGATIVE","Is this kind of a running gag?
Every day is reported about a recently adopted law which somehow violates the reason set.
It can't be a coincidence anymore."
"63","NEGATIVE","“Berlin rental cover should violate the Basic Law”

What keeps surprising me is that there is no basic legal advice before the adoption of projects, deportations or laws?

Or, in the end, our political stars are actually so incapable."
"64","NEUTRAL","Wait a minute. The opinion of the CSU-led Ministry of the Interior is that the rental cover is unconstitutional. It's actually clear that they see it that way. The Berliners have already checked this legally and found it waterproof. In the end, a court will decide."
"65","NEUTRAL","“The Land of Berlin is “prevented from enacting laws on rent limitation”,”

I also see that as well. Those who pretended to enact such a “law” should now be removed immediately from their office, because without consequences it cannot remain!"
"66","NEUTRAL","Does the issue of rental covers concern most of the commentators here? I don't think so.
That is why I find it funny how this topic is being discussed here. Are you Berlin and not a homeowner? Can you even understand in your exuberant opinion what it is like when rents rise to unbearable within 10 years, but you hardly deserve at this time?"
"67","NEUTRAL","Only the union can help. Or moving would be an idea."
"68","NEGATIVE","Why are mostly West Germans discussing here, which does not concern the whole thing? Are you afraid that it will affect your real estate at some point, should the rental cover take hold?"
"69","NEUTRAL","“Why are mostly West Germans discussing here?”

Where did you get this information?
You seem to be very sure."
"70","NEUTRAL","Once again the days were the interview with Mrs. Pop. Even the settlement of Tesla had to be resigned to Brandenburg. In this sense! You can only get chills."
"71","NEUTRAL","“Ministry of the Interior”

The Ministry of the Interior is not a court. Accordingly, this is only hot air and a court ruling remains to be seen."
"72","NEUTRAL","Not quite right! Art. 37 GG: Federal Compulsory. 
The Confederation exercises legal supervision over the Länder under Art. 84 para. 3 sentence 1 GG."
"73","NEUTRAL","In that case, the Minister of the Interior could, by analogy, waive the approval of the Federal Council in the expulsion of the safe countries of origin and a court can decide later."
"74","NEGATIVE","My impression is: the Berlin red-red-and-natural-green government is not so interested in constitutional provisions. According to the motto: “What is that? “

They think they're called to be a higher one. Maybe they were chosen for that too? 

What long-term signals are being sent to a society, so imperceptible and - I would like to say: plump - about constitutional principles (!) , they may simply not care about that!

A violation of the Constitution will not be interesting for these ladies and gentlemen until they think they have been violated in their rights. 
To the Berlin Government (where this airport is being built...), I would like to say: 'Thank you' for the 'example' they are able to give."
"75","NEGATIVE","I am not a fan of RRG but hope that the rental cover will grab and the people will still be able to live here without all their salary for the rent, which here is corresponding to the salaries, absolute usury, will be on it.
If you are already punished with RRG as a former Berlin, this government should at least do something for the lower and middle classes."
"76","NEGATIVE","Dear Heike W., unfortunately, the rental cover will do the opposite. Tenants with low credit rating will no longer be accepted as new tenants. Small landlords will sell their apartments to those self-users who can afford it. New building is not available. Thus, the market for tenants is becoming ever narrower."
"77","NEUTRAL","It's like this in Berlin itching the RRG government. Now only the VS would have to observe or banned the responsible parties."
"78","NEGATIVE","If this really is the case, I very much hope that the parties responsible for this will be monitored by the protection of the Constitution.

No tolerance for constitutional enemies!"
"79","NEUTRAL","I assume once that no one commented on here? neither affected nor homeless. That's why it's very good. I ask directly: “Do you want Weimar relations again” With the AfD it could work. Anyone who reads his election program knows where this country is headed."
"80","NEGATIVE","Robert, I am not homeless, but I am still affected thanks to my work and at some point I can't afford my 2-room apartment, despite 40 hours a week. Since my landlord can increase the rent by 15% every 3 years and this makes itself. He then always adds the rent level but it increases and is therefore completely useless and our government does not do anything about it!"
"81","NEUTRAL","Federal law breaks state law. Article 31 GG
You should know.
If a country enacts a law that contradicts a federal law, the state law is simply invalid.
Since the German Civil Code (BGB) allows rent increases precisely regulated, the Land of Berlin cannot prohibit them."
"82","NEGATIVE","Now is everything that our governments (country, city, covenant) are running in danger of being unconstitutional:? Are our politicians so incapable that you don't know before. What kind of waste of time and money is actually being done at our expense?"
"83","NEGATIVE","They simply don't seem to care, because it's just society's money."
"84","NEUTRAL","Berlin does not need a government that initiates laws in which it is aware that it is acting unconstitutional.

What Berlin needs against R2G is K2r (makes stains away, without edge...)"
"85","NEUTRAL","Does the rental cover really help to alleviate the problem of housing shortages?! 
The rental cover does not create a new apartment - who will build under these circumstances, unless communal companies with public funds. 
It would be better to continue using private capital, but also to introduce a occupancy obligation. At some point there will be an overhang of the apartment and the prices will regulate downwards.
And: New construction plans are over-bureauctatised and thus regulated costly.
If rule-compliant buildings are placed under the responsibility of the executors and builders and disregard of the rules is established, then a legally threatened expropriation should be threatened."
"86","NEUTRAL","@Volker S.: I think the rental cover was never meant to alleviate the housing shortage. With all the misjudgments of the state government, it is already clear that the rental cover strongly slows down the housing construction and the housing shortage is more likely to intensify. No, the sole motive for the rental cover was probably the protection of tenants against rising housing costs. This is not so illogical for the first time, the number of existing tenants is significantly higher than the number of those who need new housing. So voters aren't stupid. I'd call it left-wing populism. Well note, I am against the lid because I think it will harm everyone in the long run, but I do not think that a relief of housing shortages was ever intended. There will now be increased difficulties for young Berliners who are looking for an apartment for the first time, for residents and for people who need a larger apartment because of their offspring. These are the victims of this policy. First. But the tenants who first have an advantage are much more in number."
"87","NEUTRAL","This is not a new realization. According to Art. 74 para. 1 no. 1 GG, the Confederation has competing legislative competence for civil law. This also includes the tenancy law, which has been regulated in paragraphs 535 et seq. of the Civil Code since 1900."
"88","NEGATIVE","Naturally, the rental cover violates the property protection of the Basic Law.

But this has to be clicked in our Trallala country for some left-wing populists under municipal responsibility.

However, this will take a long time, as the red-green actors have a great deal with both legal and economic understanding. 

Had already been too demanding in their youth to deal with such a kind of training..."
"89","NEGATIVE",">>The rental price limitation had already been “fully and finally regulated” by the Confederation. <<
It is obviously not sufficient, at least from the point of view of the Berlin Senate. 

>>Decisions of the competent federal legislator should not be “falsified” by individual decisions of a country . <<
The choice of words is unmasking and tending. Suggested that the decision is going in the wrong direction. However, the Basic Law now also states: “Ownership obligated.” Therefore, it is at least as wrong if landlords can exclude their tenants as the proverbial Christmas whole. 

Therefore, if the state has to support more and more tenants because they are no longer able to pay rent, it is legitimate and legal for the local legislature, who has the very specific situation in mind and who has direct responsibility for them, to enact more effective legislation on rent limitation, at least what the basic rent."
"90","NEGATIVE","But it is also the state itself that increases rents extremely, due to extremely high selling prices for land plots, land register entries. Then there are countless building regulations, expensive renovation costs due to high state regulations and standards."
"91","NEUTRAL","The large housing companies have already announced that they would build new apartments outside of Berlin is perhaps better, since then maybe even cheaper in proportion, the return will then be right again. The chapter is not so easy to capture and in Berlin there will be a moaning in 10-15 years because of the restoration congestion that prevails."
"92","NEUTRAL",">new legal territory

I had to laugh."
"93","NEUTRAL","For the specialists of RRG already. 😂"
"94","NEUTRAL","When renting out there are too many laws of the Central Federal Government, BGB from Para 540. If you want to settle something at the country level, a country must first get the competence from the federal government - i.e. foederalism reform.
If the rental shoe is printing in Berlin, then a suitable federal law must first be established, which assigns renting to the Land of Berlin. Then the location is clear and clean. On the other hand, in order to undermine the tenancy law by means of administrative law, is condemned to reject from the outset, because actions are based on the existing centralist legislation."
"95","NEGATIVE","It turns out again that laymen have little idea. But it has always been easy to promise something, scream around loudly, and then, when the child has fallen into the well, blame others for it. Well meant is not well done.

But the laymen of the Berlin Senate are not interested in that. For that, they have approved a generous salary increase."
"96","NEUTRAL","This increases the hope that R2G will “bathe” with its uneconomic wishful thinking 
 And above all, it remains to be hoped that every voter recognizes R2G and Berlin, that must have an end."
"97","NEUTRAL","It seems to be a specialty of the Berlin government of writing unconstitutional legislation. Unfortunately, the existing problems, such as Riga Street, lack the desire for the need to apply the law."
"98","NEGATIVE","Why am I not surprised as a Berlin that these decisions violate anything. The red-red-green Senate has not yet managed anything meaningful during its legislative term. The BER has not finished and all other decisions and legislations, and I will not give any details here, have also failed. One should consider before acting and then deciding. For this there are the self-proclaimed “experts”"
"99","NEGATIVE","Profit maximization has its limit when the common good is at stake. In that sense, the court ruling will fail."
"100","NEUTRAL","This will certainly be true in capitals such as Paris, London and Rome.
Or do we want to set standards again that others will not adhere to?"
"101","NEUTRAL","Let me quote an opinion. I'm not a lawyer myself.

“Basically, the Länder have legislative competence, unless Article 73 GG (exclusive federal legislation - there is definitely nothing listed here that could affect) or 74 GG (competing legislation) determine something else.

Then the BMI should state what legal basis it relates to. It could, at best, be subject to competing legislation, but then the BMI in the area (s) of law and, if necessary, already enacted federal laws, should clearly state themselves as contended general places.”

The fact that a CSU-led ministry is positioning itself against a legislative initiative of RRG is not surprising in itself."
"102","MIXED","I agree with them, you're not a lawyer."
"103","POSITIVE","The rental cover is already very successful, it shows where the wind blows. None of my acquaintances invests a penny more in his rental housing. Conceptually designed conversions for new showers, electrical works even water-saving taps are not realised."

Here is an excerpt from her own hompage: “I am a Berlin woman and a member of the city, like so many people here. For my studies at the Technical University, I came to this city and today I have a degree in Philosophy (B.A.) and Historical Urbanistics (M.A.).”

Philosophy and HISTORIcal Urbanistics! Where is the causality of modern urban development?"
"105","NEGATIVE","I don't understand.
Why does “modern urban development” mean that everyone can rent an apartment at a low price in the center of a capital city?
The next thing is the sale of building land only to deserved comrades.

That is hardly to be outdone in boldness.
They probably already know they're violating the law, but a court is supposed to settle it for them.
Such a thing can also be examined beforehand by lawyers and it is true: if the court overturned the law, everyone was harmed - for nothing."

One thing is obvious: the senators aren't exactly competent."

"119","MIXED","We still have that? Now I'm unsure."
"120","NEGATIVE","So, I think it is completely excluded that even any decree or decree at RRG in Berlin violates the Constitution.
At least not against those of the former GDR!"
"121","NEGATIVE","You just left chaotic things from Berlin. Looks like the city is really broken. Can't Berlin be traded for something meaningful?"
"122","POSITIVE","I would be for Munich:)"
"123","NEUTRAL","In the end, the Constitutional Court has to decide. Actually, the matter should be clear!"
"124","NEUTRAL","Clear: See GEZ"
"125","NEUTRAL","In the current year, the permits for building applications in Berlin decreased significantly, and in September even fell by half. 
The deputies of the Left Katalin Gennburg, tweeted:

“What kind of connections are these?! The new building 'breaks' because of the rental cover?! Why? Causalities, please! “

Seriously, she really said that."
"126","NEGATIVE","Maybe Mrs Gennburg should build a house with funding from banks.
Then you wouldn't have to ask for causalities."

"128","POSITIVE","Yes, they have created absolutely heavenly conditions for dealers, albeit (so far) only in the Görli 😉"

"130","POSITIVE","They'll run the money for so long."
"131","NEUTRAL","Who would have thought that? RRG is a case for constitutional protection."
"132","NEUTRAL","The CSU-led Interior Ministry says a lot when the day is long. What matters is what the BVerfG says about it."
"133","NEGATIVE","Socialists are rehearsing the coup d'état in small terms. The rule of law should be alarmed."
"134","NEUTRAL","It was clear months ago, wasn't it?
Why did Berlin go on like this for the first time?"
"135","POSITIVE","Better to put it, they'll blow it out."

Soli-Abolition
CO2 tax
What am I glad that the rights of citizens are so important to the people who govern and govern this country
Everything is really incredibly well thought out and not at all alone on catching the voters from"
"139","POSITIVE","Recognized correctly, it's all about pure charity. No one wants to take off citizens' money here, it's just for their own good."
"140","NEUTRAL","Can the Senate actually be held liable for damages that arise, for example, to a landlord, if at some point a nullity of the law turns out to be invalid, but this was also expected before the decision of the law, so one more or less intentionally a presumably breach of constitutional law Say goodbye?"
"141","NEUTRAL","No, no, no.
The law would not be passed by the Senate, but by the House of Deputies.
Moreover, the alleged damage of the landlord would be fictitious, since it is alleged lost profit."
