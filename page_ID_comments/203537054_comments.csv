"1","POSITIVE","“Hello, rental cover!” means, above all, “Bye, climate modernisation!”. Say the Berlin housing cooperatives, who have been making flats without profit for more than 100 years, just as Vonovia & Co. Ramona Pop, the green economic senator, was the inspiration of the SPD mayor Müller at the welcome ceremony for the rental cover. 

While the Greens are constantly blowing “climate change, but pronto” through the Megaphone, so that the WRR and the Republic are only so roaring, they actively prevent that where they are in the government. And undismayed tell the fairy tale about the guilt of the Federal Minister of Construction Seehofer, CSU. 

At the same time, green commissioned researchers for G-20 (“Brown to Green”) note that with emissions in the building sector of more than three tonnes per inhabitant, Germany is almost 50 percent above the EU average and twice as high as the G-20 average. Overall, the emissions of the G 20 in no other sector increased as much in 2018 as in the building sector — by 4.1 percent. For example, the rate of refurbishment of the building stock must be five-fold for a climate-friendly course. 

The Berlin stock of old buildings is likely to play a significant role.

Mrs Kemfert and DIW: a case for you - please intervene! The climate would thank you!"
"2","POSITIVE","Well, I'm sure the RBerlin Senate will find a quick solution. For example, the expropriation and socialization of rental, construction and maintenance. Centrally controlled, everything works much better and cheaper."
"3","POSITIVE","@ TwoCents is even very well proven in North Korea, a model for all those who want to help Mrs Lompscher, ex-SED: clean roads without cars, everyone gets an apartment, goes without capitalism, if you only have a caring state. Mrs Lompscher, ex-Stasi chief official Holm, already has a counselor for solutions of this kind."
"4","NEGATIVE","logically thinking hard to think
But perhaps the left-wing parties (RRG) do not want to preserve the economy and prosperity, but create a super-poor and thus docile mass."
"5","NEGATIVE","I can quite understand the landlord and I find the rental cover frightening and actually in the wrong direction (socialism), but unfortunately the problems are really homemade. The greed of over 85% of the landlords was really shameless and absolutely predatory. No matter what area/area, any behavior sooner or later results in a consequence. And whining now is inappropriate. Change it for the future and keep measure!"
"6","NEGATIVE","“The greed of the landlords”, you really can not hear that anymore. Low interest rate, building codes, every year new great ideas, how the landlord can be tricked, no expulsion of building land, far too little new construction, etc. These are the reasons why the rents are rising. 
Every tenant could have bought an apartment ten years ago. But this is associated with risk, and the tenant does not want that."
"7","NEGATIVE","The rental cover becomes only a good thing. Traffic congestion and pollution are reduced as all craftsmen no longer have to go to work with their trucks.
“I'm sorry about the broken water pipes, but no one pays for my pay.”"
"8","NEUTRAL","Although I am not a landlord in Berlin, I have experienced similar experiences with our Super Chancellor Kohl. After the change, the people who have paid good taxes forced into a kind of forced investment in real estate in the new Länder. Who did not buy 50% special depreciation gave the state taxes.

After the price bimp after 7 years, rents fell from 14 DM to 7 DM. Even in Munich, where I was invested, prices had been reduced by 20%. It was a super minus business.

These are the qualities of our politicians! And today the Merkel, who allows us to pay the EEG allowance so that the energy companies can sell electricity without power, without which they have to pay in return. Or the departure from nuclear power without a concept. Or the scourge that makes money like a school boy and has to pay the penalties of the citizens. I can't see this pack anymore."
"9","NEUTRAL","The fear is unfounded. Berlin has long since fallen into decline and is only artificially kept alive through money mergers from the state financial compensation and political circus. Berlin, the “sexy bride” who is more zombilina than princess."
"10","NEUTRAL","Has there ever been a socialist thought that would not have led to chaos?"
"11","NEUTRAL","“Socialism wins” was proclaimed on countless banners in the GDR. The banners have disappeared for 30 years, but maybe Erich Honecker was right after all. If he watches Berlin from the sky, he will not be able to confine himself a slight smile. Greetings"
"12","NEGATIVE","Hopefully not from the sky..."
"13","NEGATIVE","In fact, renting in big cities makes no sense for city dwellers, if you look at it purely in terms of booking. All the effort could be made redundant if the rents are completely eliminated. So do not rent cover, but abolish rent. In the future, the Ministry of Finance will be able to transfer the rent directly to the landlords."
"14","NEUTRAL","Left has the majority. Self-chosen sufferings. So what!"
"15","NEUTRAL","@thomas h. 

jepp, and for decades!

In the last 70 years, the Federal Republic of Germany has been largely led by the conservative (CDU), with a few years by an SPD government. In Berlin, the situation is exactly the opposite. The consequences of such electoral behaviour are obvious!

And everyone who now comes to me that everything would not be so bad, I make it very clear that Berlin will be kept alive by payments from the state financial compensation alone, that is, by payments from the donor countries. 

Woe, the willingness of the donors eventually diminish, only then would the complete extent of Berlin's inability materialise quite massively."
"16","NEGATIVE","“But now, at the age of 70, he feels for the first time misled by politics.”
No, no, no. Not a lump-sum of “politics”, especially of typical red politics."
"17","NEGATIVE","The red have never been able to calculate, and will never learn, because they always confuse mine and yours"
"18","NEGATIVE","I would terminate the landlady on own use, then at least the children can cheap housing and the market lacks again an apartment."
"19","NEGATIVE","So the multiple emphasis on “extremely expensive” for a top kept, renovated old building apartment in preferably wanted location (Prenzlauer Berg) incl. great fitted kitchen and balcony, I find something strange!

This seems to me like wanting to go to the star restaurant and then complain about the “extremely high” prices.
That doesn't fit together. 

Nobody forces someone to live in a privileged location who cannot or does not want to afford it, just as nobody “must” in the star restaurant."
"20","NEUTRAL","Berlin gets what it chose. The housing planning industry seems to be mostly in favour of this country, and the three very left-wing parties together still have a clear majority. However, we should immediately stop subsidizing this swamp through national financial compensation."
"21","NEUTRAL","@Angelo V.
Berlin is not a swamp but our great capital."
"22","NEUTRAL","Well, what else can you say? The Berliners elected their own government."
"23","NEUTRAL","If “children” who have not yet completed their education are already acted as Chancellor, you don't have to be surprised at anything and the large crowd is silent!"
"24","NEUTRAL","What do you expect from people who call themselves politicians and who have never earned a euro?"
"25","MIXED","The old misunderstanding. Socialists make politics against the rich, not for the poor."
"26","NEUTRAL","The rental cover helps those who need help. Of course, additional construction needs to be made, the municipalities are required, after all, they have put up the social housing."
"27","NEUTRAL","Didn't you read the article?"
"28","NEGATIVE","I do not find him bad, this socialist attempt at the “rental price brake”. Why not try something like that, to succeed or to fall strongly on the muzzle, get up, straighten crowns, breathe deeply and go on. No problem. What I find bad is the left/soicialist way that if something goes wrong, you invent even more “social” rules, become even more common and patronize people even more. That's the crux. For a Sozi would NEVER come up with saying: “Oh, that didn't work out, now we probably have to leave this thing better to the market, because freedom regulates the problem better than the socialist noble jail with its many rules and regulations”. If one could do so: it would also be a possible reaction to Berlin's housing shortage to scour the building regulations there, to radically simplify them, to build a reputation for being the poorest country in the FRG, which gently rolls out the red carpet to investors. But that will not happen: for left-governed authorities with their regulations and gossips on earth are the closest thing to eternal life in terms of perseverance (freely quoted according to Ronald Reagen, 1964)."
"29","NEUTRAL","With the rental cover, the opposite is achieved to alleviate the shortage of housing. If I were a politician on the supervisory board of an urban housing company, I would also demand the cover."
"30","MIXED","What good is the rental cover if heating systems last only 12 years instead of 25 years, that has to be priced in the rent Per month 30 Euro on it"
"31","NEGATIVE","And from 02/2020 Hamburg will be the “Laboratory of the World”
The fact that this whole left-wing hocus pocus will eventually be removed legally is only a weak consolation. The reversal is devouring a huge amount of money... Tax revenue!"
"32","MIXED","You can't blame the left-minded people. Can't count and can't deal with foreign money, because everything that can be covered is capped. The taxpayer is here. He stands for everything straight. Now let landlords cover. Many companies have resigned from construction projects, investments are lost and in the end the need is even greater. But it's going through. No matter what happens. Socialism in its course..."
"33","NEUTRAL","@Berti
“The definition of madness is to keep doing the same thing and expect other results.” Albert Einstein (supposedly)"
"34","NEGATIVE","A little premonition of what is threatening in Germany if red red red green should determine politics at the federal level. Anyone who chooses this cucumber force at all is no longer to help."
"35","NEGATIVE","So if I hear the whining tone of the landlady who paid off an apartment after about 8 years, with a ratio of repayment + interest to cold rent of 4:3, then I have to say that she made a very good deal, even with half the rent it would probably still be fine now. The fact that a lower return does not fit your planning is one thing, but you must not rely on it. And even more so do not press on the lacrimal gland.

On the other hand, she took the risk and should now have the right to get the best for herself. RRG could increase the available housing space through improved planning and investment, which would definitely be better."
"36","NEUTRAL","It's okay if she made a good deal. But, as in the article, she has a lower income than many of her tenants and there you can ask yourself whether the rental cover can be socially fair at all."
"37","NEGATIVE","A “wealthy” contractor from the Kurfürstendamm fears that the fat years might be over. The entire dooming scenarios of the lobbyists are nonsense, especially that no one will rebuild! When I bought my hut in Prenzlauer Berg 19 years ago for 500 euros the square meter of living space, the renovation area and the rents were capped by the district office to €4.50. Nevertheless, like all the other owners, I have elaborately renovated the houses with about 1 million euros and cheerfully removed the costs from the tax. I would never have dreamed of writing, and I am almost embarrassed by the fact that brokers are pressing me again and again today to sell the house for 6 million and my property manager now calls €13,00 rent for the same stalls.
So, little lid on it, would be OK and bring not only the rents but also the house prices maybe again a bit to the ground!"
"38","NEGATIVE","The two examples are (intentionally) not very convincing.
1. A woman who buys a condominium, rented extremely expensive to use it in a timely manner to supply her daughters - that means a total payment within a few years thanks to extremely high rents. OK, she finds such tenants, but she shouldn't complain about it, she benefits from housing needs, nothing more. And now she's worried that something changes.
2. A small craftsman who has now built up many larger plants thanks to the construction boom is now concerned that the construction boom is going down. Who has finated the construction boom so far, and why?

The fact that in both cases a completely wrong policy (only a rush of government relocation, false immigration policy ff) was the cause of a complete misdevelopment, of which both were heavy beneficiaries, is not seen by both.
Basically, both are like the Greta followers: Lauthals complain, but no other suggestions in mind."
"39","NEUTRAL","“Who financed the tree boom?”
More housing is still needed and needs to be refurbished even when and when and when this happens, jobs are created and tax revenues generated. What do you mind? 
And the proposal is quite obvious: tamping the rental price cap."
"40","NEUTRAL","Accurate article that reflects one's own experiences.
With the rental cover, the opposite is done. That's what pretty much everyone with knowledge of the industry said before. Only our city authorities think they can regulate a market by decree. 
Working instruments were available with the rental brake and the rental mirror. The average rent is 6.72 per square meter. Only the new seekers have problems. With an increase of 50,000 people per year and hardly available public housing, you don't have to be a prophet to know what's wrong here..."
"41","NEGATIVE","What is logical for every person with a little common sense, the RRG politicians do not seem to be able to grasp.
Especially those with little income in old, unrenovated apartments will also be the losers of the CO² tax. Because which landlord will still insulate the apartments if he can not implement the costs. You prefer to pass the increased heating costs on to the tenants. Although the rent is capped, the utilities will continue to increase each year, as the 
Governors will not be able to cover their revenues, they prefer to increase them many times each year."
"42","NEUTRAL","If left-wing make politics, then that's the case. And it always goes until it all coincides."
"43","NEGATIVE","Left politics stop. That's all you need to say. But there are enough voters who are unable to see through this. And this is a big problem in Germany."
"44","NEUTRAL","As it was said in the GDR: “Create ruins without weapons”. 
Examples from other countries (Vienna, Basel) or continents (USA, San Francisco) have already shown where the capping of rents leads. 
But no, RRG won't look beyond the outskirts, bet?
And later, the RRG politicians will unison announce that this could never have been expected..."
"45","NEUTRAL","It's also simple logic. This helps in the short term those who do not have to move and that only until you feel the lack of investment in the building material.

Otherwise, the question arises why someone in Berlin should create new living space? He can rent anywhere and in many conurbations as expensive as he would like."
"46","NEUTRAL","“Decreasing investments mean less housing construction. And this means an even greater housing shortage in the long term. “

And this conclusion requires only a minimum of common sense."
"47","NEUTRAL","If I had an apartment in Berlin and it was free, I'd sell right away. More and more apartments are being deprived of the rental market via the rental cover, but how should one teach the communists?"
"48","NEUTRAL","After all, the rental cover is only an intermediate step and nationalized the real goal."
"49","NEUTRAL","That's how it is. In 30 years, it looks like it was 30 years ago in Berlin."
"50","NEUTRAL","@ Liberal engineer... like 30 years ago in East Berlin (you said for sure)"
