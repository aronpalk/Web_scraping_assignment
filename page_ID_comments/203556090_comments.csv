"1","NEUTRAL","In the CICERO issue of 15.11.2019, 
there is an interesting guest post that can be read online, titled:

“IS returnees, The underestimated danger of women and their children”

As you know, Merkel sees no cause for concern.

The federal government should realise that ISIS fighters who see in their children “lion cubs” who are supposed to carry jihad to their home countries with their 
violent indoctrination and empathic parent-child relationship are in stark contrast to modern Western views of the child's good and the dignity of the child.

It's definitely worth reading."
"2","NEGATIVE","The government's rulers have a single moment thought of the danger we are facing. I'm so tired of watching that not a single politician is willing to stop this madness."
"3","NEUTRAL","The good old “member of a terrorist association” no longer exists.

Quote, 
5. Anyone who supports an association referred to in paragraph 1, 2 or 3 shall be punished with imprisonment of six months to ten years in the cases referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, with imprisonment of up to five years or with a fine in paragraph 3. Any person who advertises membership or supporters as referred to in paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 shall be punished with imprisonment of six months to five years.

Relate to anti-state associations whose purpose is, among other things, murder, manslaughter and genocide.

Everyone who has traveled to ISIS wanted to become a member."
"4","NEUTRAL","She married an IS fighter, moved to Iraq and got 100 euros for her household services. Is that self-information? Are these verified facts, investigative results? Or the portrayal of a prisoner for their own protection, and should not at least be clearly marked, since it may want to appear itself in a more positive light?"
"5","NEUTRAL","Why can't she be in custody in Syria or Iraq?"
"6","NEGATIVE","If women who have worked for a terrorist organization can't be prosecuted, our laws are overhauled"
"7","NEUTRAL","Two women have been deported.
Is there only one need to investigate whose she was guilty?"
"8","NEGATIVE","Like prateits with the embarrassing Miri Drama, this federal government does not want to give itself a wide-ranging idiot and mitigates the ability to act. Probably first googled what means ability to act."
"9","NEGATIVE","Have no doubt; our leaders are not the most competent."
"10","NEGATIVE","All Turkish offenders immediately return to Turkey. Our steering is a joke. If Franz Josef knew that."
"11","POSITIVE","Good man, we have empty prisons."
"12","POSITIVE","The German taxpayer will probably have to grab more and more in his pocket. The way it looks 2019, still happy."
"13","NEGATIVE","Before Germany takes over even a single IS-supporter from Turkey, Turkey would have to take back the approximately 7000 Turks who have to leave!!! And it's pronto."
"14","NEUTRAL","Politicians of the SPD and the Gruenen are happy to speak of Germany's “duty” to bring ISIS terrorists back. It is an international convention that crimes must always be judged and punished on the ground according to local laws. It is clear that the majority of their crimes cannot be prosecuted here in court. It is also clear that, in the best case, the Islamists will incur enormous costs for their monitoring and supply. In the unfavorable case, they will plan terrorist attacks and spread the seeds of hatred of “unfortunate”. They won't be a gain for this society."
"15","NEUTRAL","Gisela, name the politicians of the SPD and the Greens who speak of Germany's duty to reclaim this issue. An international convention is an invention on your part, and there is no such thing. Why don't you leave such fairy tales?"
"16","NEGATIVE","At the RAF, everyone was considered guilty, regardless of whether they could prove it individually. Suddenly, this is not possible.
Everyone and everyone knew where and to whom he was going knew about terror and murder. Whoever supported this is guilty."
"17","NEUTRAL","If something happens, Mrs Merkel will tell us that all-encompassing safety can never be guaranteed. She's right about that. But it is their duty to minimize the risk factors for the population. And she does exactly the opposite and increases the risk."
"18","NEGATIVE","I look very skeptical about this, something bad will probably have to happen again for the ruling elite to react. Verification by state bodies, as seen at the BAM, does not work. And all because we blindly trusted a despot in Turkey who is now putting us under pressure."
"19","NEGATIVE","Since “Amri” my trust has fallen to zero on the federal government. “Insured” “Ensuring” these are for me appeasement formulas, which have long been no longer available for me."
"20","POSITIVE","You have the feeling that it is almost willingly provoked that something is happening here. I do not want to live with such people, sit on an airplane, bus or train, nor would I feel comfortable and safe in their neighbourhood and present. Should they be placed in the neighbourhood of those who advocate this and consider it safe and safe. Good luck."
"21","NEGATIVE","Well, receiving full care instead of justice in Syria. So sad our politics."
"22","NEUTRAL","Yes, and if the “Joint Anti-Terrorism Centre of the Federal Government and the Länder” comes to a different assessment by Mrs Merkel? Then what?
Then Mrs. Merkel shrugs her shoulders and says: Now they're here.
Why does Germany take over a German-Iraqi family at all?"
"23","NEUTRAL","“Accordingly, it is of course ensured that these people do not pose any danger. “

It is better to say no danger to our politicians, otherwise the decisions would be different."
"24","NEGATIVE","Because of such people, they want to build a “moat” around our politicians.
But the ordinary citizen never gets a building permit for this."
"25","NEGATIVE","I hope that Mrs Merkel did not take over with her statements yesterday. Germany already has problems monitoring all the perilors."
"26","NEGATIVE","In case of doubt, monitoring causes too much work, as in the case of Amri."
"27","NEGATIVE","Even if individual security was ensured by all-round monitoring
then costs would come on the taxpayer to go to the waterless."
"28","POSITIVE","I'm sure the people at the LKA are exaggerating. Our Chancellor said there was no danger.
Don't get upset, it's all in perfect order!"
"29","POSITIVE","I very much hope our security forces have all this on screen.
How can you insure such a thing if you know so little?"
"30","NEUTRAL","“The BkIn has assured that the German authorities guarantee... , “
What if not? 
It is possible to verify what opinions the now “cleaned ex-jihadists” and their 
possibly already have “indoctrinated children”?"
"31","NEUTRAL","“.. These people would be subjected to a security assessment in the Joint Anti-Terrorism Centre of the Federal Government and the Länder. “Accordingly, it is of course ensured that these people do not pose any danger. “

Yeah, sure.
See Berlin Christmas Market, Axtmann etc."
"32","NEUTRAL","@clodett m.
and even if the gem. Terrorist defence centre could do what happens in the cases where there would be a negative judgement of the security assessment? That's right, nothing."
"33","NEUTRAL","“The further action is in the hands of the security authorities of the federal and state authorities.”???
Yes, like the works, many readers have noticed by the current case “Amri/Breitscheidplatz”.
But don't worry our chancellor says “No danger”!!"
"34","NEUTRAL","The case “Amri” is about as topical as the terrorist cell from Chemnitz or the NSU terrorists.
More recent is the terrorist attack in Halle, whose perpetrators had no one on the screen."
"35","NEUTRAL","Now as a state that itself demands from other countries that they should take back their compatriots who have become criminal with us, we are obliged to take them back.
Politics and also our judiciary are now required to take the necessary steps that these people pose no danger to our society."
"36","NEUTRAL","The difference is that we only “demand” the withdrawal by other countries. We ourselves take back all those placed on a plane."
"37","NEUTRAL","What legal construct was again used to raise charges against the 93-year-old SS security guard? That would have to be applied here too."
"38","NEUTRAL","That would mean an independent and unidiological judiciary."
"39","NEGATIVE","These terrorists, in my opinion, are women who would never have noticed here because they had nothing to say. Nobody listened to them. Questionable, Dangerous?"
"40","NEGATIVE","members of a terrorist association who belong punished. They decided voluntarily to do so, just didn't work so well with the Islamic state... the only right thing would be to call everyone, man or woman to account!"
