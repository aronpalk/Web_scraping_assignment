"1","NEUTRAL","Lawyer Sayn-Wittgenstein knows how to express herself, and as far as her AfD membership is concerned, the last word is not spoken. I am now waiting for those who have carried out their exclusion at the Bundeparteitag, for example Meuthen, who has not been nominated as a party congress delegate in his own district association."
"2","MIXED","The lady follows the rule of all right-wing extremists, it still goes a step worse.

If the boar Stegner throws himself into battle, he does so without squeamidity. Hearty words are said quickly. But it means a huge difference whether one consistently denies or relativises the crimes of the Hitler dictatorship. Persons of such attitude are absolutely unworthy of a state parliament. The ad is appropriate, a sign of political reason."
"3","NEGATIVE","She was excluded from the party because of misconduct but the main thing in the heading is again AFD with it. The ad is okay but has nothing to do with the party.
And as they have already charactered Mr Stegner, he should not be so sensitive."
"4","NEGATIVE","‚ÄúWhen will the first green-red-black reeducation camps come, when will the first concentration camps of the new Nazis come? ‚ÄúSayn-Wittgenstein continues: ‚ÄúThis (...) feels like dictatorship. At the latest, the regime has dropped Merkel's mask. When are the first ones picked up? ‚Äú

Well, let's be honest - politically correct, the statement is certainly not. But where is the concrete insult here and where is the incitement of the people? 

Isn't it the case that Stegner with his tweet from 2016 ‚Äúremains a fact, you have to attack positions and personnel of right-wing populists because they are yesterday, intolerant, right-wing and dangerous!‚Äù with reference to the German Civil Code ¬ß 130a (Instructions for Offences) and ¬ß 130 (Incitement to People's Incitement)? In addition, it claims to everyone in its statement that all attributes mentioned therein apply to the positions and staff of the AfD. Thus, ¬ß 185, 186 and/or 187 StGB may still be considered with regard to staff... Apparently, he's not such a blank sheet when you evaluate his way of communication. So, whether the right person has made the ad, in my opinion, is questionable - just as its content..."
"5","NEGATIVE","@Ronny K.

1.) Once you have to explain what is offensive or incitement about the utterance, I dare predict that you will not accept the explanation.
2.) Does a crime depend on who made the complaint for you? - It's worrying.
3.) If you want to take action against Stegner's statements in 2016, go ahead, good luck."
"6","NEGATIVE","I watched the video of this woman and was once again horrified at the masked and robotic style of her talk. Memories of long-forgotten interviews with East Bloc officials and RAF terrorists rose up in me again. Just like then: this complete captivity in one's own ideological cage, The evident break with reality. Creepy."
"7","NEGATIVE","See how your applicable comment is evaluated here. 
This is a cause for concern! 
It's bad!"
"8","NEUTRAL","@Michael S. There are deputies of the left and the SPD who are set to the extreme left or how do they explain themselves a Fr. Renner with their ANTIFA sticker on the lapel in the Bundestag?"
"9","NEUTRAL","@Tania M., schools have to teach politically neutral. What educators think politically they can tell their circle of acquaintances after work. Any questions? ü§î"
"10","NEGATIVE","Hard tobak, no doubt. But Stegner's loudest calling for the prosecutor is hard to beat in double standards. He's the first one to throw around with completely inappropriate Nazi comparisons."
"11","NEGATIVE","The two actors are not too much in terms of hate messages."
"12","POSITIVE","I really don't like to hear or read from Mr Stegner anymore!
And I feel like I'm not alone with this view.
It is all the more surprising to me how often it is reported about him:
‚ÄúMr. S. has done this, Mr. S. has ‚Äútweeted‚Äù that!‚Äù etc.
Now he has reported Ex AfD - Madame Sayn - Wittgenstein,.. so!
This man is, I think, certainly with a reason for the decline of the SPD and actually any statement of him, whether right or again wrong, hurts the party 
Nevertheless - or precisely because of this?! - he is quoted unusually often!
Slowly in my case the suspicion that he is constantly found in the media because of his unpopularity!
Many voters are angry with him - and with that - intentionally or not - about the SPD too!
This kind of reporting is certainly not good for the party, but perhaps it is to blame itself, since it has not long since complimented this gentleman out of its ranks."
"13","NEGATIVE","The whole thing seems disturbing.
Who is Mr. Stegner that he anticipates a conviction against Sayn-Wittgenstein in public by means of publication? Has any court made a statement that the lady in question is ‚Äúright-wing radical‚Äù or has Mr Stegner not himself in the fat bowl with this public accusation precisely because of insult or even incitement? 
This media presentation by Mr Stegner is worrying when politicians presume to preempt the courts by public incitement against any person. Where is democracy and the rule of law, if everyone publicly insults another by insulting ‚Äúright-wing radical‚Äù and become famous for it? I find it terrifying how Mr Stegner deals with this matter. Even more frightening that the old parties have him granted instead of leaving the proceedings to justice without publicly disparaging anyone for anything. Even politicians have no right to denounce anyone so publicly, just because they don't have a different view in the stuff. So, really pretty disturbing, the whole thing."
"14","NEGATIVE","Are you disturbing Mr. Stegner and not this radical right-wing lady and her statement? Significant!"
"15","NEUTRAL","Public statement:Mr Stegner, please note that their party and also their comrades, are constantly denouncing the AfD.
There is from fascists the Redey, there it says then since the AfD consists only of right-wing radicals and it is also called that on the part of the SPD. So Mr. Stegner expel them and spread the nonfree on the part of the SPD and then the SPD claims to be a democratic party and says the AfD would not be. another laugh number of the SPD, just as its party comrade Lauterbach made the AfD responsible for the health of other parliamentarians in the Bundestag as the main responsible for this publicly. One has to withstand conflicting issues and opinions in a democracy and these should then also be discussed. To let out everything at the AfD is silly and dismantles an SPD into infinity.Better would be the conversation and the confrontation with the Afd and not forever this arrogance.In this sense and with the best wish that an SPD finally grasps it, cordially politics today for tomorrow, a supporter of the FDP."
"16","NEUTRAL","You don't have to like Doris von Sayn-Wittgenstein and her statements published on social media, but this middle-time ex-Afd lady naively chatted out what is also called the ‚ÄúPeople's Voice‚Äù. Whether she's somehow right about your utterance or not, everyone should locate that for himself. However, a Mr. Stegner from the SPD is not an unscorned ‚Äúleaf‚Äù, who publicly called ‚Äúto attack Afd staff at their information stands‚Äù. Not only in this statement, Mr. Stegner, also known under the pseudonym ‚ÄúP√∂bel Ralle‚Äù, has revealed his true identity and personality to everyone. Mr Stegner or Mrs Sayn-Wittgenstein simply do not belong to politics, because these two people, in particular, act so emotionally and give off things that simply cannot be reconciled with the daily political business. That is why a woman Sayn-Wittgenstein was also excluded from the AfD. A Mr. Stegner is still a party member of the SPD! It's just that..."
"17","NEGATIVE","‚Äúto attack Afd staff at their information booths‚Äù

He didn't say that. If you quote, then please be correct, otherwise a wrong picture could be created."
"18","NEGATIVE","The fact that Mrs Sayn-Wittgenstein was excluded from that of the AFD Group for good reason is deliberately ignored by the leftist trench fighters in this forum. This eliminates a dividing line that disturbs these people, without which everything that does not subordinate to one's own left view of the world without criticism can be defamed in unison as extreme right-wing and silenced. This behaviour is as hysterical as Mrs Sayn-Wittgenstein's statements and Mr Stegner's complaint."
"19","NEGATIVE","The other way around, it turns out to be a shoe: those who excuse or even affirm this woman's allegations are taking the victim role of the AfD into the field. They seem to have not yet noticed that this person is no longer a member of the AfD (Group)!"
"20","NEGATIVE","Unfortunately, the article shows an inaccuracy: ‚ÄúLandtag President Klaus Schlie (CDU) had called on the MEPs to resign immediately.‚Äù This part is misleading, dear Welt Online. Ms. von Sayn Wittgenstein is no longer a member of the AfD. It should be correct: ‚ÄúLandtag President Klaus Schlie (CDU) had called on the MEPs to resign immediately.‚Äù Half-formed readers believe that Sayn Wittgenstein's wife is unattached, but still a party member. In the lower part of the article, the above-described partlessness is quasi removed and reduced to parity. This is malicious and manipulative!"
"21","NEUTRAL","Exactly.
And the manners of a Mr. Stegner are not exactly... Let's call it ‚ÄúMal ‚Äúgroomed."
"22","NEGATIVE","Somehow many commentators seem to confuse terms: Frau von Sayn-Wittgenstein is not a (!) AFD member! It was even explicitly excluded from the party!"
"23","NEUTRAL","But not from the federal board of directors, which should make you think very much about the drive of this lady!"
"24","NEGATIVE","Doris von Sayn-Wittgenstein, von Storch, Prince August of Hanover etc. These so-called nobles are just embarrassing. Fortunately, we're not a monarchy."
"25","NEGATIVE","Where is Mrs. v. Stork embarrassing? Where is SKH Ernst August von Hannvoer embarrassing? The prince is seriously ill and barely in public. 
Ms. v. Sayn-Wittgenstein is not of nobility, she got the name through a dubious chain of adoptions."
"26","NEGATIVE","Just Mr. Stegner who, for example, already tweeted ‚Äúright-wing populists attack ‚Äúshould hold back something!"
"27","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúI don't think the people think that way,‚Äù said Grote.
He thinks, but he doesn't know.
Many politicians also believe that the people want a CO2 levie/tax.
With faith, one can calm one's conscience, but not twist facts."
"28","NEUTRAL","I'm also part of the people. I find the CO2 levy right and think that taxes are important for peaceful coexistence. Of course, tax justice can be argued honestly. All of us should not presume to believe that there is a united will of the people that anyone would have to implement. Such a thing never existed and existed in liberal societies. We must, in each case, look very hard to find compromises with which the majority can live. Representative democracy is exhausting and demands a lot on us, but nevertheless the least bad system I know."
"29","NEGATIVE","This woman cannot and must not be taken seriously. 
Similarly, the Minister's statement 'This woman does not belong to parliament', because whoever belongs to parliament does not determine a government or a minister. At least this is/was the case in a democracy."
"30","NEUTRAL","Parliamentarians also have certain boundary conditions such as laws."
"31","NEGATIVE","It is interesting that many of them are still locating this scavenging lady at the AfD and exculpate her unspeakable statement - yes, the legitimate complaint by Mr. Stegner also refer to as an attack on the AfD. 
Dear AFD fans, now you have to be very strong: this dubious lady is no longer a member of the AFD Group. Why their position is obviously interpreted as their own AfD leaves a deep eye. Very deep!"
"32","NEGATIVE","The prosecutor's office will not bring charges because the accusation is unfounded.
Incitement to the people is an official offence, i.e. the prosecutor's office does not need a complaint to bring charges."
"33","NEUTRAL","This lady showed her true face."
"34","NEUTRAL","No Name

 This lady showed her true face.

The Lord, too."
"35","NEGATIVE","Mr. Stegner is a radical left-wing politician and now really not a sympathetic bearer, but if only because of this dubious nobleman with their dubious views and Nazi contacts, all ethics goes away and is really no longer to help."
"36","NEGATIVE","@Jack: I agree, but that also applies vice versa who now lets the Stegner live up and depicts as fantastic upright Democrats that is equally no longer to help."
"37","NEGATIVE","Did I understand this correctly: the lady compares politicians from the SPD and the Greens with the National Socialists? Such statements testify to stupidity and ignorance. I really have to wonder how she managed to become politicians."
"38","NEGATIVE","Why would that be illegitimate? Much more regular comparisons are made against the AfD... Anyone who distributs must now be able to plug in."
"39","NEGATIVE","Pooh... Stegner is not really my case but here he acted more than right. The woman belongs to a court, disgusting!!"
"40","NEUTRAL","Only questions have been asked here and there are no claims. In the criminal sense, this will not entail any consequences."
"41","NEUTRAL","Anyone who belongs to Parliament, thanks to God, decided not by the other parties or other Members but by the sovereign, that is, the voters."
"42","NEUTRAL","Even as an elected Member, we must adhere to our laws."
"43","POSITIVE","Significant that such persons as these Doris had found a political home in the AfD. 
With a bit of luck, she would even have become party chairman in 2017. H√∂cke and they find themselves very sympathetic."
"44","POSITIVE","Clear - both are part of the so-called AFD ‚Äúwing‚Äù. Just like Brandner."
"45","NEGATIVE","This lady disproves herself with her stupid and rushing statements. If she were almost right, she would already be there for a long time now. Instead, it uses our liberal democratic basic order to spread its radical views. There is no objection to this, but it is not contradictory. Unmasking that she doesn't even recognize this. Apparently, her bitterness is so great for her insignificance that she seeks this form of attention. Don't worry, we can withstand this person and his radical opinion, even in a parliament. That's exactly what distinguishes us bourgeois from this radical lady. There's nothing more to say about this person."
"46","NEGATIVE","P P P.

 This lady disproves herself with her stupid and harrowing statements

Why don't you confirm the woman with each of your words? Don't you do exactly what this woman criticizes? You have no arguments and therefore want to ban it, but you do not have to do that in our basic order you have so promised, but only a court. Before criticizing others, you should grab your own nose.
Here and there, babbber,"
"47","NEUTRAL","What's the problem?

Frau von Sayn-Wittgenstein continues to be a member of the Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein, unattached and NOT belonging to the AfD. Whether I think that is good or less good is not the debate here.

To my knowledge, there are sufficient rules to withdraw immunity from an elected Member (s) of a German parliamentary institution if Parliament votes for it by an X majority because of an envisaged procedure.

So why such ramp stories? Mr Stegner certainly has the necessary legal advice to ensure that he tries to bring what he intends to the stage cleanly. 

If he fails - I'd like to report.
Should he succeed - please send a report."
"48","NEGATIVE","I'm curious to see how prosecutors and courts react. Incitement? The sentences are certainly full of rubbish, but I cannot see racism or glorification of dictatorial ideologies. I'm not a lawyer either. For me, the topic is hung too high and thus only gets a meaning. Mr. Stegner has a topic for two weeks."
"49","NEUTRAL","Tweet Ralf Stegner of May 8, 2016: ‚ÄúThe fact remains, you have to ATTACK positions and personnel of right-wing populists because they are yesterday, intolerant, right-wing and dangerous!‚Äù"
"50","POSITIVE","He is absolutely right about that."
"51","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúTo his knowledge, there has been no case in the history of the Federal Republic in which a Member had been withdrawn from the mandate.‚Äù That would be something! But some would be surprised if the people were to withdraw their mandate after a short time because of inability."
"52","POSITIVE","This is where Mr. Stegner is right. Exceptionally."
"53","NEGATIVE","So you can also moor the victims of the concentration camps..."
"54","NEUTRAL","It's normal in the AfD."
"55","NEUTRAL","The legislature could think about whether a member who leaves or is thrown out of his party loses his mandate if he has not come to the Bundestag via a direct mandate. That's what you could say in a law. For if the party had not included him in the candidate list, he could not have been elected.
That would mean that any Member who changes or leaves or is thrown out of the party will automatically lose his mandate! And that would be perfectly fine in the eyes of most voters.
I would find it horrible if, for example, I vote for the Greens and then one of their MEPs switch to the AFD, for example! Conversely, of course!
The AFD has separated from Sayn-Wittgenstein, the Bundestag could do so if it passed a new law!"
"56","NEGATIVE","Yes, the freedom of the mandate should get limits!"
"57","NEGATIVE","The AfD has proved that it is capable of action. She threw the woman out, even though she was elected president again."
"58","NEUTRAL","Who actually elected the woman as president of the state shortly before?"
"59","POSITIVE","The sympathetic Ralf, does his job well! Show posture!"
"60","NEGATIVE","I must vehemently disagree with them. 

There is no more unsympathetic politician in Germany"
"61","NEGATIVE","Sayn-Wittgenstein is intolerable for Parliament. What left this woman off the pile politically makes me stunned. But at the same time it is also a warning to parties to what extent they themselves are determined by ‚Äúsentiments‚Äù, where freedom of expression is really in danger? 

I'm not trying to excuse Sayn-Wittgenstein's behavior. But it may have a core of truth, with which parties have to change. At the same time, it is also a new change on the subject, which really means freedom of expression, how far it can go. However, if politicians like Sayn-Wittgenstein support an organisation of Holocaust opponents, for me the border has crossed far. There is no such thing in Parliament."
"62","POSITIVE","The members of the AfD in Schleswig-Holstein apparently found the woman very convincing."
"63","NEGATIVE","Purely linguistic hint: applications are being made. Advertisements are reimbursed (as Mr. Stegner has also properly tweeted)."
"64","POSITIVE","I'm looking forward to the verdict"
"65","NEUTRAL","Stegner, of course, does not rush.
I'm not an AFD voter, but I'm getting anxious too.
Stegener should consider why there are more and more BI/voter groups in the municipalities."
"66","NEGATIVE","I'm not, but - and there you can already stop reading"
"67","NEGATIVE","The grotesque is that it was the AfD who called on the people to denounce critical teachers via internet portals. In this respect, at least 3 fingers point to the married princess"
"68","NEGATIVE","‚Äúto denounce critical teachers.‚Äù

Nice as they try to twist known facts, teachers should be reported who, contrary to the Neutrality bid, try to instinct THEY Political Attitude to students.

What should the dissemination of one's own political attitude as a teacher to the pupil have to do with ‚Äúcritical‚Äù can they certainly explain?"
"69","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúTo his knowledge, there has been no case in the history of the Federal Republic in which a Member had been withdrawn from the mandate.‚Äù

So what?
That's not a hindrance.
You just have to adjust a little something. You can do it if it serves the good cause."
"70","POSITIVE","Mr. Stegner is right. Exceptionally."
"71","POSITIVE","Necessary! Thank you, Mr Stegner."
"72","NEUTRAL","All deputies are representatives of the people, whether the views suit each citizen or not."
"73","NEGATIVE","The ‚Äúpeople‚Äù that this woman chooses can remain stolen from me."
"74","NEGATIVE","And this woman was elected chairman shortly before her expulsion by the majority of the AfD group in Schleswig-Holstein.

I'd like to ask every single member, why?"
"75","NEGATIVE","What is incitement and insult is, thank God, not Mr Stegner, but ordinary courts. And they should do their job now, and then we can see what is incitement and insult, and what is not."
"76","NEUTRAL","@ Markus B. You're right. And so that the courts can do their job, Mr Stegner has indicated Mrs Sayn-Wittgenstein. So he did well."
"77","NEUTRAL","Look at the honourable Member. Such one deputies brought us the afd to parliament."
"78","NEUTRAL","These were the voters, the AFD cannot bring a member to parliament."
"79","NEGATIVE","Well, the SPD Federal Vice President Ralf Stegner is not necessarily on my political line, but with the statements of Mrs. von Sayn-Wittgenstein I can only support his complaint. This lady of ‚Äúsham nobility‚Äù lost all levels of political decency and correctness."
"80","NEGATIVE","@Alexander K. I can only confirm or that is the case of all AfD temporary women, because also Mrs. B.V. Storch should rather fly to your husband to Chile sheep and dream of world domination. I can only thank my late grandmother of a born nobleman and the Great Manitu for marrying bourgeois because otherwise I would have to deal with such dull baking in my kinship."
"81","NEGATIVE","Waiting to see if Stegner's criminal complaint for incitement and insult leads to criminal proceedings.

If no, Sayn-Wittgenstein has spoken out in a non-criminal manner.

Why don't you just take a political look at it from the outset? Argument in ‚Äútime-tested way‚Äù in the matter? Without foam in front of the mouth? 
Doesn't seem to be the kind of politicians now established. It's a shame."
"82","NEUTRAL","Does Mr. Stegner really enjoy immunity?"
"83","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúTo his knowledge, there has been no case in the history of the Federal Republic in which a Member had been withdrawn from the mandate.‚Äù

Vice President of the Bundestag, European Parliament Vice-President, Old President of the German Bundestag, Chairman of the Committee.

Forget what?"
"84","NEUTRAL","Who has been deprived of his parliamentary mandate?
No one."
"85","POSITIVE","This is where Mr. Stegner is right. Exceptionally."
"86","NEUTRAL","I then watched the video. Without this report, I wouldn't have figured it out. I guess I'm not the only one with that. She asks a few questions. If this is still allowed, a court has to clarify. I'm curious."
"87","NEGATIVE","Apart from the AfD, this Stegner cannot mob anything at all, I share Mrs Wittgenstein's statement 100%."
"88","NEGATIVE","Please, think again about your comment. Whether left-wing or right-wing conservative, it is simply not possible to link current politics with concentration camps. Read a history book, make yourself smart and comment objectively."
"89","NEGATIVE","Stegner runs around with a face as if he were eaten by hatred - well, he may not be able to do that, but the impression is just the same, and what he gives of himself is not exactly the love of the Lord. No wonder that even his own comrades didn't want to choose him. He is not elected, he is only by list place on his post. You really don't need much to report about such a politician, but it's good to bring quotas something against the AfD. This is really boring and transparent."
"90","POSITIVE","Sayn-Wittgenstein describes Germany's democracy as a ‚Äúregime‚Äù and describes democratically elected representatives as ‚Äúnew Nazis‚Äù.

I rarely agree with Ralf Stegner. But here he is completely right, good that he does not let such people intimidate himself."
"91","NEGATIVE","I see the other way around. 
The people are not involved in essential decisions. There are no referendums, as the AfD calls for them according to the Swiss model. Now we have the salad: euro, Greece, refugees, pension crisis...

This government's method reminds me very much of Orwell's farm of animals. Mrs Napoleon likes to get in touch with the ‚Äúothers‚Äù. The people are not asked or manipulated. 

Only the 80% sheep bleal the crap the Altmeier aka Squealer announce unreflected after. Four legs good - Two legs bad Welcome to the ‚ÄúBundes-Animal Farmland‚Äù."
"92","POSITIVE","I wouldn't have noticed this video without Mr. Stegner. Thank you for pointing out."
"93","NEUTRAL","And this woman has twice been able to gather a majority in her party behind her in Schleswig Holstein..."
"94","NEGATIVE","Which doesn't make things better. If you are already thrown out of the AFD, there really does not have much to say anymore."
"95","NEUTRAL","The incitement paragraph is designed to protect minorities in the country. However, this does not include the SPD, despite its significant shrinkage."
"96","NEGATIVE","Even if I do not share the position of Sayn- Wittgenstein: even more clearly than Stegner, one cannot demonstrate absolute helplessness and lack of argumentative abilities to the outside.
The so-called top staff is just embarrassing"
"97","NEGATIVE","Do you want to discuss the nonsense with this woman? With all the necessary respect here, you can't be serious!"
"98","MIXED","I personally believe that left opinions are overrepresented in public law and that the Greens feel like they are sitting in every talk show. 

What this AFD woman achieves here, however, I find a cheekness special like. To call green links as new Nazis and to blame them for opening KZs I find inconceivable. 
To abuse the cruel crimes in the CCs so much, the AFD must not be surprised if it is portrayed as a right-wing radical!"
"99","NEGATIVE","Why is represented!?
The AfD is partly right-wing radical. And Trump is a corrupt liar. All facts."
"100","NEUTRAL","If grazing can be called Nzi slump without impunity, then the video goes through. K√ºnast also fell on the nose, dear Ralf. Do you really want to judge that such videos and statements do not fulfill the offense of incitement or insult? Okay, but please don't cry afterwards when the independent German judiciary decides against you."
"101","NEGATIVE","Can't pasture. That went only in this particular case me because of the context to clarify that PC is just sometimes appropriate."
"102","NEGATIVE","‚ÄúI don't think people think that way. ‚Äú
Bad German for a Minister of Interior.
Thoughts are free, who can guess them...
That the gentlemen are not mistaken, the people of the Great Lolk may not be able to express themselves like that."
"103","NEGATIVE","It seems to me as if any discourse is extinct. It is displayed, defamed, accused and insulted by all sides. Otherwise, everyone simply puts their ideas in the room without worrying about the feedback."
"104","NEGATIVE","Their choice of words may be drastic, but the problem is not the choice of words, but the invitation to the people to denuntiate friends and neighbors. One of the most disgusting and archetypal characteristics of dictatorships. My sympathy is more likely to be with those who desperately defend themselves against it, even if I would express myself differently."
"105","NEUTRAL","The AfD can't mean them by ‚Äúfighting back‚Äù. She just rebuilt her denunciation platform against teachers."
"106","NEGATIVE","I think it must have been in third grade. The teacher was told when somebody said something stupid. In the fourth grade, we missed it so as not to give too much attention to the stupid people.

A great article on the topic ‚ÄúWhy is Germany polititikverdissen?‚Äù."
