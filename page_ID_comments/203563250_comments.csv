"1","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúNow we no longer choose only inveterate eco‚Äù

- No, among left-wing extremists the party is also very popular"
"2","NEGATIVE","‚ÄúNow we no longer choose only inveterate eco‚Äù No it's hard to believe! After their voters no longer go to church and no longer believe in God, they accepted this ‚Äúgreen substitute religion‚Äù. I would prefer the Greens voters to go back to church and stop voting for the Green Eco sect!"
"3","NEUTRAL","The Goblin, which stores electricity in the grid, is almost 100% Maddin. May the melon party in the Bundestag election be the same as the SPD. If the Greens want to be left-liberal, then the AFD is in any case bourgeois."
"4","NEUTRAL","I am a real eco, but I cannot vote for this party because social coexistence is as valuable as eco-issues."
"5","NEGATIVE","A new Fukushima will probably not be available to play the Greens in the cards, as the only Greens could have experienced as MP in B-W. This does not say anything positive about the quality of governance in B-W.
According to the results of the Party Congress in Leipzig, the other parties will probably be happy to bring their own, sustainable and prosperous programme to the people in order to achieve politically the Greens's formulated claim, a different kind of prosperity with prohibitions, as well as eco-taxes. Plausible to oppose.
The Green Dream of being able to influence the world climate with national laws restricting personal freedoms does not have to be dreamed of by the people in the country in the elections.
 It is overlooked that the prosperity of the country and its citizens will only be ensured by the functioning value chain of industry and trade in global competition. Without this, the welfare state will quickly reach its limits. out of sight!"
"6","NEGATIVE","@Karl N. Jawoll, 2‚Ç¨ in the right pocket 5‚Ç¨ out of the left pocket. As I said the normal worker goes by mid-year for father state chuckling and of the rest there is not much left see electricity prices. Is already a cheeky taxing electricity with 19%. This is a commodity that you need to live like bread and butter. But caviar and horse feed tax at 7%, just sick. 
."
"7","NEUTRAL","Mr Kretschmann knows only too well that these federal greens are elected in the major cities in the north.
It looks very different in the country. In BW or Bavaria or in the new L√§nder, Habeck or B√§rbock would not even take it to local chairmen. 
Kretschmann himself has been elected, although he is a green man.
His desolate predecessors have paved the way for him."
"8","POSITIVE","‚Äú... inveterate eco...‚Äù! Magnificent formulation ü§£"
"9","NEUTRAL","If you knew who chose ‚Äúnot‚Äù!"
"10","NEUTRAL","@Dieter B.
That's how it is. Approximately 87% of voters prefer parties from the democratic spectrum and continue to show the right-wing AfD the cold shoulder."
"11","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúNow we no longer choose only inveterate eco‚Äù

True, now also the ultra-leftists

Never selectable for me"
"12","NEUTRAL","@Seel√§nder, that's what I thought too. At the end of the 20s, one of them studied his mimics and gestures in front of the mirror and has come very far."
"13","NEUTRAL","Electricity prices will rise by 5% next year, so always choose green and CDU. The money that the simple man worked hard to take up there so easy away for EEG levy CO2 tax etc. And a large part of the population chooses these parties that care about their own population."
"14","NEGATIVE","Yes, correctly and in the new environmental law, they say that citizens will be relieved again and the price of electricity will be lowered."
"15","NEUTRAL","Elsewhere it says that the Greens are below 20%. Whose perception is wrong?"
"16","POSITIVE","For the first time in a long time again fell below 20%, very good so! This must go on like this!"
"17","POSITIVE","Whoever chooses this deserves no pity."
"18","NEUTRAL","That's right. AFD voters know exactly what they're doing."
"19","NEUTRAL","The green ones have triggered waves in many ways, which - as with many mass movements - lack objectivity. When I see the demonstrations and coverage of the Brazilian rainforest... That's what we had in school classes in 1978. Since then, forests have been burning in California, Greece, Italy, France, Spain,... EVERY year. But in Brazil, one has the power that certain people don't want. So, you knock him down. Just like they deal with their opponents everywhere. Regarding environmental policy, there has been awareness and action in Germany for about 60 years. All values have always improved. And Germany is only a small part of the world. Do the greens actually know that the sea level only rises because every inhabitant in Wanne-Eickel takes a shower twice a day?"
"20","NEGATIVE","Annalena is very nice, Robert is not stupid, Winfrid isn't anyway. But why are they still for Globules and all the homeopathy spells? - And why do they still believe that the electricity can come from the mills & panels, although even the good Mr. Schellnhuber of the Potsdam Institute wrote in the FAZ himself that the storage problem is still unsolved - and that an energy transition without memory cannot work? 

The green energy transition without functioning memory is basically homeopathy for engineers. - An experiment with our economy with a very uncertain outcome. - Unfortunately, the same can be said of the unregulated immigration that the Greens promote where they can.
 
The Greens are getting deeper and deeper into the error zone. I'm hoping for a lot of disillusionment, and I think it's gonna take some very cold showers for that."
"21","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúNow we no longer choose only inveterate eco‚Äù 

... but also people who don't think."
"22","NEGATIVE","@ Dr. Strange 
Of course, you confuse this with AFD voters who make blind right-wing AFD phrases their own."
"23","NEUTRAL","They would only have a chance with me if wind turbines were installed in Berlin, Munich and Stuttgart and not only far from the city residents. Everywhere ‚Äúin the province‚Äù, the landscape is devastate with solar and wind farms in order to implement this transverse energy policy. In fact, one would have to give Habeck and Baerbock a calculator with operating instructions, maybe they come to the point that their bill cannot be opened."
"24","NEUTRAL","I hope I wake up to the next election and all this was a bad spook, because Bielefeld doesn't exist. Then a dememorable CDU under Merz and Maa√üen makes sensible policies with a FDP that is committed to supporting social market economy, secure borders and a constitutional state capable of acting."
"25","NEUTRAL","when the goblins don't make a stroke through your dream.
The goblins store all, even commuter packages in the electricity grid."
"26","NEGATIVE","In any case, I definitely do not belong to the green voter potential and hope that this country will not be governed by these amateurs."
"27","NEGATIVE","@Maiko 
That's right. It would be economic and political disaster for the Federal Republic if right-wing AFD amateurs came to power. So far, the majority of voters has been too smart for such mischief."
"28","POSITIVE","I very much hope that the GREEN will have to assume responsibility for government after the next Bundestag election. Then they must finally ‚Äúconfess color‚Äù! Let's see what will happen to Mrs Baerbock and Mr Habeck if energy prices continue to rise and the economy is down. I'm very excited!"
"29","NEUTRAL","That would be the end of Germany"
"30","POSITIVE","It speaks for the political reason of voters that two EU-oriented and, above all, democratic parties (UNION and GREEN) are high in voter favor. A merit of Mrs Baerbock and Mr Habeck."
"31","POSITIVE","@Siegfried W.: Respect, he was good. üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
"32","NEGATIVE","The election results are largely due to the will to demonstrate unity.
For it is incomprehensible to me that this quota for mediocre politicians corresponds to the true views of the intelligent voters."
"33","NEGATIVE","Mediocre politicians? But they give the rest of the politicians a bad testimony. If green politicians want to store electricity on the grid, suspect goblins in the Li-Ion batteries, squabling over commuter packages, and have o-clue about it, that's more than embarrassing. And such a thing gets GDR election results of 97.1%!"
"34","NEGATIVE","The Greens are not a party representing certain classes or classes in the traditional sense. They unite environmental protection and their members and voters cover a spectrum from very left to very conservative. In order to play a greater role in politics, these environmentalists must deal with all social problems. Contradictions and position struggles within the party are therefore preprogrammed and this makes the Greens difficult to predict. To determine the German policy guidelines, clarity and maturity does not seem to be sufficiently recognizable."
"35","NEGATIVE","Anyone who has the choice is tormented, more agony than choice, I mean."
"36","NEUTRAL","Ecotax r, cans of pledge and EEG hurt the small earner. The environment, too. Everything that this party touched costs us a lot of money, but brings exactly garnix. I will never elect this party"
"37","POSITIVE","I follow the Greens Party Congress, the reflection in the media very closely - and note a very ‚Äúbenevolent‚Äù consideration. I am therefore very excited about the media processing of the Party of the CDU, SPD. In addition, the Party Congress of the Greens has something to do with 'Germany seeks the superstar' (in the media perception) - Habeck comes over as a philosophical cuddly candidate with three-day style; the counterpart, the pretty, sexy... good dressed medium-sized eco-business lady... so spectra are covered... so today the 'modernity' sold. We'll see where this leads."
"38","NEUTRAL","Yes, but the voice of Baerbock, the voice... aua."
"39","NEUTRAL","Germany was on the ground after the First and Second World War and has risen again through diligence, education and the will to perform. If the Greens ever get to the lead, Germany will soon be on the ground again, but whether there is still a willingness to perform a new start is questionable. The green ideas are really cute but rarely thought to the end and there they usually do the opposite."
"40","POSITIVE","This is also my great concern"
"41","NEGATIVE","How was that arrogance again?
what came after..? ü§î"
"42","NEUTRAL","The case"
"43","NEUTRAL","Now it is time to pray for little rain and hot summers until the BT election. Otherwise, it won't be."
"44","NEUTRAL","Goblins and tax advisors to power.
There is a book, a well-known board, which is understated when you calculate it for the future."
"45","NEGATIVE","Mrs Baerbock is the one who seriously thought that Merkel's trembling was to blame for climate change! 
And so someone is elected? I can't believe it! Why do I only get the trembling when I think of the future of this country?"
"46","NEUTRAL","Did she really say that?
I can't believe it, I can't believe it. 
Who chooses that."
"47","POSITIVE","That's right. Now also choose rich and better deserved. They don't expect anything anymore, and they don't know where to go with their voice. But it'll be done soon. Better earners are dying out."
"48","NEGATIVE","Merkel has also been spoiled in dealing with the Greens. After Fukushima abolishing nuclear power, the Green voters did not bring her back. On the contrary, many have already turned away from the CDU through this train. Then came in 2015 and again it turned out that the government is completely overwhelmed when it gets tricky.
The Greens and the AfD benefit from Merkel and the weak SPD. Please stop the Greens being unnecessarily stylized as if they were ready to govern."
"49","NEGATIVE","Inmeated-Eco? I think they're rather vegan eco. As a Germanist, the eyes hurt in this title."
"50","POSITIVE","Thank you, you're so blind. Beautiful laughter, but describes the ambivalence and bigotry of this radical party very carefully."
"51","NEGATIVE","Now the renegade SPD voters vote green. So what? Nobody was able to explain to me what they actually promise from the change. Maybe one or the other SPD defector reads here and has mercy on me?"
"52","NEGATIVE","I fear the renegade SPD voters from the former regular clientele of the autochthonous working class now vote AFD. Somewhere they have to come from"
"53","MIXED","But dyslexic people who have their problems?! Otherwise you can at least explain that where I come from (performance counts, not how many children's books I have written or goblins I have caught)..."
"54","NEGATIVE","It's almost like Star Wars.
Motivator 1
Motivator 2
Gender asterisks are deliberately omitted here."
"55","NEGATIVE","Children choose the Greens, so they want to push the age for voters further down.
People who stand in life, pay taxes and do not work in the administration and work for the state do not choose Greens. I want to see the face when in 2 years then only 8.9% are there again. √ñR media manipulate all the way."
"56","NEGATIVE","That's exactly my problem.
There are sent by GEZ Fees Day Daily one-page reporting.
Which actually can go through advertising as a party."
"57","NEUTRAL","If only inveterate eco were to choose green, Mr. Kretschmann would not be a head of the country. 
The Swabians have long since recognized the essence of this party.

If the conservatives should find themselves again, then in BW you prefer to choose the original."
"58","NEGATIVE","Nothing is impossible. A large part of former SPD voters. The complete amount, in about 3.7 million,
German newcitizens who feel comfortable in our system no matter how comfortable, all of them are guaranteed not the
Select AFD. The rest is easy to guess. 
In ancient democratic Athens, one would have to prove:
That he's a real Athenian.
 That he served in the army and took part in campaigns.
 That he regularly pays taxes.
 That he was honest and was never found guilty of a crime.
 That he believes in the gods and is committed to the good of the city.
If he was elected in office, his fortune was accurately recorded and recorded, even the value of his sandals was mentioned.
If, for ignorance, negligence or other reason, it would have to return everything.
pay. His belongings were confiscated and he had to work the rest until the end of his life.
Airport Berlin, etc., a look into the black book... of taxpayers.
No merchants, no strangers or permanent guests who stayed in Athens for a short or long time could neither be elected nor elected."
"59","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúNow we no longer choose only inveterate eco. No, no. Now choose vegan yuppies.

Habeck therefore called for a ‚Äúcourageous policy‚Äù: ‚ÄúBut if one's own anxiety becomes a measure of politics, then politics is ready,‚Äù he said.

Well said. A little populist maybe?
But anxiety is the DNA of the Greens:
Fear of market economy
Fear of competition
Fear of technology and technology
Fear of degrees of any kind
Fear of sound criticism
Fear of free development

Help against this:
First and foremost prohibitions
But also regulations and lids
Jute bags
Excursions
Party didziplin
And
On a personal level;
Exclusion (Cem √ñzdemir by CGE on group presidency)
bullying (Boris Palmer von Vielen) or 
Cuddle (with LandesPapi Winfried Kretschmann)
Vice-presidency in the Bundestag (due to age Claudia Roth)
Roar (Anton Hofreiter)
Pray (Kretschmann for Merkel, according to his own statement).

After the chronic indignation of Claudia Roth did not bring much, now a camoufled restart is being tried.

A children's book author with a gammel-look and a well-groomed banality ambassador are ready to serve the fears of the electorate in a wide range of ways. 

Hopefully the procedure for the acquisition of power will be undertaken by the voter.
New commanders in chief are not needed after the Mummy era."
"60","POSITIVE","And the advertising drum runs up and down again with the German media, so nice photos of politicians are usually rarely seen. What do you think this is?"
"61","NEUTRAL","HB.: Probably they are as nice as the other politicians are not nice. Of course, the most ‚Äúunkind‚Äù are AFD politicians. That's why the pictures are also appropriate. However, photographers may only see what they can sell or just see what they want to see and then, at the appropriate moment, press the shutter button. The rest will be done by the editorial offices. In any case, we have the same result. Mr./Mrs. X from the Greens always looks like this and so, PARTIALURLPLACEHOLDER Y from the AfD always looks very different."
"62","NEUTRAL","Trittin would certainly have reached 150%..."
"63","POSITIVE","Photo:
The dream couple of the year before the departure with the dream ship!
N.B.: Have a nice trip to nowhere, and please stay there!"
"64","NEUTRAL","Has the Annalena found her goblins yet?"
"65","NEUTRAL","They all voted for them"
"66","POSITIVE","It was clear they're celebrating now. The Greens promise the ultimate breakthrough of these two candidates to lead and new bans and more taxes."
"67","NEUTRAL","... or the misguided bourgeois, who have not understood the electoral programme and the consequences, or are less affected as officials than executives and entrepreneurs.

Amazing."
"68","POSITIVE","Yes, even the completely eager, the neo-communists and people who want to see themselves and others oppressed choose you."
"69","NEUTRAL","Do not understand why these ‚Äúsensational‚Äù election results should now tune in to ‚Äúmore‚Äù (seen at the federal level). SPD once had a 100% candidate... where is he now? FDP, Lindner 91%. Why is ‚Äúchancellor sentiment‚Äù spread here again for a party that has no 20% nationwide (tendency to decline)?"
"70","POSITIVE","And the excellent result for so many people to choose from. What are they supposed to do when no one else is there as a counter-candidate? It's no wonder that such percentages come together."
"71","NEGATIVE","I was really shocked. No not about the emotional appearances of Mrs Baerbock, Mr Habeck and some others. I almost got the tears that the Greens have now discovered the workers, the homeless and the weakest in society, since they have hardly any of them in their party.
No, Mrs Baerboock is now also involved in foreign and military policy. Only it has avoided the use of the word strategic interest.
No, they are incredible to me, and some of the speeches of the candidates for the board sounded too much like slogans and homage to the party. This went partly without comma and dot, so breathless through the afternoon (based on Helene Fischer)."
"72","NEGATIVE","I had to switch. I don't like noise..."
"73","NEGATIVE","Can somebody wake me up from this nightmare, please? A tax increase means CO2 pricing, German state borders only exist in the Atlas and 16-year-olds trigger eco-fascism. I'm going crazy!"
"74","POSITIVE","That's what I've been wishing for quite a while to wake me up! Urgently, indeed. You summarized everything wonderfully."
"75","NEUTRAL","Times change: 
Previously, the CDU and the SPD were parties that were closed and had strong leadership, while the Greens were a disputed bunch of crushed wing battles. Today, the Greens are very closed and have strong leadership, while CDU and SPD are disputed piles and are crushed by wing battles."
"76","NEUTRAL","Habeck: ‚ÄúWe have to make the difference. We must focus on reality, we must not be guided by anxiety.‚Äù

Can someone from the forum explain to me who Habeck is referring to and what he means? I am more aware of the Greens that they dare to solve all the problems.

Does he mean inner-green forces who are afraid of responsibility in a federal government?"
"77","NEUTRAL","He probably means if he should pronounce the word Germany"
"78","NEGATIVE","Such a hype! I bet the Greens will not reach more than 15% in the next Bundestag election.
What legitimizes a party that doesn't even choose a quarter of the population to represent itself as the coming government and the party that represents the chancellor? 
The Greens will always remain a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù party when it matters.
People in Baden-W√ºrttemberg will also rethink when the wave of redundancy, which has long since started (Bosch, Audi and suppliers), comes to a proper development.
Let's see if Mr. Kretschmann still comes to such survey values."
"79","NEUTRAL","Ronrick T.

Bosch, Audi and - not to forget - Daimler
 Plus Suppliers"
"80","NEUTRAL","The Greens in government responsibility mean: 
- even more economic refugees into our social system, even more open borders, even more parallel societies, even more tax money thrown out 
- even more welfare state and redistribution, even more prohibitions and restrictions
- even more erosion of nation states in favour of Brussels, Germany assumes even more costs and responsibility for a non-functioning euro system
- even more insanity in terms of energy transition, transport transition, agricultural transition... 
- even more political-correctness, hyper-moralism and opinion dictatorship
Why the CDU gossip bunnies are running after these people is inexplicable to me. Everything that draws DEU down is original green and Merkel copies it."
"81","NEUTRAL","That's exactly what it is.
Why do the mass of voters not understand it?
I mean, these are all things that are visible to everyone.
In D, it is not about right and left but about substantive issues and how to deal with them."
"82","NEGATIVE","Unfortunately, it has become a so-called ‚Äúunpopular opinion‚Äù when you are against the Greens."
"83","NEUTRAL","Well, then, even more so."
"84","NEUTRAL","So at us in the new federal states choose only (appearance) eco and left-wing extremist this party, certainly not the broad bourgeois mass.
Here outside the 67+ year old is mainly blue, and above the 67 left and CDU chosen.
Greens have almost failed due to the 5% hurdle."
"85","NEUTRAL","The ‚Äúbourgeois promise‚Äù has already been broken in Bremen, the CDU has won significantly and now R2G is ruling and the same will happen if there is a majority in the BT election for red-green, the results of red-green governments can be evaluated in Bremen, Berlin and NRW, high indebtedness, high crime"
"86","NEUTRAL","NRW= black-yellow has entered the legacy and is now trying to correct the mistakes"
"87","NEUTRAL","This means that our expert in political physics has significantly more voices like media favorite HaBeck. I can only hope that she will then make use of her right to access the chancellor's candidacy.

Another way to prevent the Greens in the next government, I don't see..."
"88","POSITIVE","@henriette, Chapeau, you have to think not emotionally but strategically. The 97% are good for our country, because I assume that most of the citizens can still think sensibly and in the case of a future BTW, hopefully swiftly, will consider giving the voice to this extreme physicist and chemist.

Can at most become problematic when AKK is taking place on the dark side of the power."
"89","NEUTRAL","For the Greens it is similar to Macron or Schulz: they are systematically written upwards to land over short or long as a bedside rug."
"90","NEGATIVE","Citizens will soon see how expensive green policy is and will become even more expensive by air tax, gas stations, tenants and landlords!
I dare to predict that shortly before the next BT election of the green hype is finally over and they are again just below 10% where they belong."
"91","POSITIVE","I hope so."
"92","NEUTRAL","Oh, dear, oh, dear! 
Schnatterinchen elected chairman with 97.1%, even before the big communicator!"
"93","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúCobbler... stay with your ledges!‚Äù
We still know these high-altitude flights from the SPD party congress with the highly pushed Martin Schulz, who sang afterwards and disappeared without sound in the sinking.
If you've learned one thing from this is that the air up there gets thinner the further you rise up. ü§î"
"94","NEUTRAL","You may dream, reality will catch up with you. The Swedes have already done it. Socialist ideas such as rental covers and expropriation are not good for the long term."
"95","NEUTRAL","Now, with the exception of the European elections, which should not be regarded as a measure of national concerns, the Greens have not yet demonstrated this thesis."
"96","POSITIVE","I've never chosen the Greens in my life, and that's a good thing."
"97","NEGATIVE","I voted it with the second vote in the Bundestag elections in 1990, 1994 and 1998 (with the first vote SPD), which was a big mistake. Will not happen to me again"
"98","NEUTRAL","The Greens are the CDU/CSU for the generation year 82+. The parents or grandparents of this electoral client are the voters of the parties mentioned above. The SPD and its voters are only good for this group of people, of course this is not said because it does not fit into the social context. You can talk to these people, but you already have your opinion on these clients and say them among his own. But to the outside..."
"99","NEUTRAL","It should be the other way around. Soon, even inveterate eco will not choose the greens. The Greens here will follow the path of the Greens in Sweden."
"100","NEUTRAL","Your word in God's ear..."
"101","NEUTRAL","The Greens party congress speeches reflect their populism fear in climate without offering real solutions, especially to the younger ones as an alternative without being one. Sociopolitical - protection of minorities, but please not in their villas or ‚Äúbetter neighborhoods‚Äù. Against right-wing extremism - the Greens have the absolute truth. Populists are just right, well, just not right. They want to power together with the CDU. But the Greens actually come from the bourgeois CDU milieu, are not workers. But one wants to be better than the CDU, because as a greener one represents progress, the good, the moral one is simply better than the others. No, thank you green."
"102","NEUTRAL","No sorry, greens, please don't be arrogant. There is exactly one reason for your success in the polls and some state elections: the exceptionally good economic situation in Germany. The European elections in the spring showed that climate protection a la Greens must first be able to afford. Hopes that Germany will not slip into a serious economic crisis. Then you will quickly find yourself where you've landed in elections all the past few years: with 8 -10% of the regular electorate."
"103","NEUTRAL","The European elections showed that the Greens were able to increase sharply to 20.5%, especially in Germany. But in general, the Greens are more of a German phenomenon, because in the whole of the EU they reached only 9.9% and have 74 seats out of 751 seats in Brussels."
"104","NEGATIVE","Mr. Kretschmann,

the many ‚Äúincidents‚Äù in BaW√º will one day be measured by percentages. We are still halfway in a good position. These are reserves from a few years ago. At the latest with the sharply rising energy costs, bakeries, butchers, etc. will fear customers. These are the new customers of the discount stores. I'm sure until the next elections several citizens will consider where to go with the cross!! Similar to medium-sized industry."
"105","POSITIVE","I predict that this Green MP was an exception and that the Greens will certainly no longer be able to ask Prime Minister.
That's good for the country and the people.
However, this MP has something meditative in its voice and you get to sleep well."
"106","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúThe Greens are no longer a civic movement. ‚ÄúWe are a political force that has the mandate to design‚Äù

 This will make them very dangerous to the CDU, because the Greens are now fully accepted right into the deep bourgeois camp.

 It's no wonder either, because the Greens are often the children of bourgeois CDU voters and the Greens voters are among the ‚Äúbetter earners‚Äù"
"107","NEGATIVE","In that case, one can speak of luck that the better earners account for just 10% of the population and I know a number of better earners - including me - who the Greens wouldn't even choose if they put a gun in front of us."
"108","NEUTRAL","Breaking news: Federal Party Day of the Greens has declared the Merkel era ended. Robert Habeck was elected by the delegates by an overwhelming majority as the new Chancellor. AfD was banned."
"109","POSITIVE","Great news! I'm fine. The latter is very good."
"110","NEGATIVE","I think even Joschka gets scared at what he sees. It is now to His millions that he can no longer pass on to His children. Only Gabriele and Claudia don't have the problem. I understand, too."
"111","NEGATIVE","2 (!) For days the front page full of our ‚Äúbeloved greens‚Äù - this is certainly a little too much for me for a paid subscription... balanced looks definitely different for me!"
"112","NEUTRAL","Relax. Approximately 9 percent of the citizens voted by the Greens in the last Bundestag election, with a turnout of about 75 percent. This party therefore remains further niche, with well-known marginal issues. True gains are currently benefitting other parties. The music will play here in the future."
"113","NEUTRAL","To whom exactly do the voices benefit? At the federal level, I see only the Greens from big winners."
"114","NEGATIVE","‚ÄúNow we no longer choose only inveterate eco‚Äù. In fact, it is. But we should not be blinded by the Greens. I think it is necessary. However, not with survey values of 20%. Often they were completely wrong in their demands. The latest technical achievements proved to be not as sustainable and future-proof as often predicted. Perfect renunciation of one way or another, switching to other ways of life, often never led to the desired success. Old problems may have been solved in parts, other problems have emerged or will emerge (diesel ban, nuclear ban, electrically powered vehicles, renewable energies, power grid expansion, etc.).
And what do the Greens do better in the end. Here it is enough to have a look at Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Ranking in educational policy - negative. economic power - negative. Wind power expansion - negative. Achieving climate policy goals - negative. roadway extension for cars - negative. Cycle path network- let's see. How many people will actually use them - let's see. 
What they can do: drive a wedge between rural population and urban population. Demand from Green Minister for the Environment: Reduction of the 1000 m limit for wind turbines. But these are only created in the countryside. What a CDU mayor, hunted by Greens, demands: build car parks in the country and drive to the city by fast bus, etc. 
Please listen carefully, judge and evaluate. One thing is for sure. The Greens are not a salvation."
"115","NEGATIVE","They are not and will never be salvation charms. They have no idea of economy, nor of technology/future technologies. Their way of stabing the future is most likely to end in a peasant state."
"116","NEUTRAL","I wish one of them as Chancellor

I hope for a green final sprint for the Bundestag elections so that they will put the chancellor. No matter what coalition.

Green-red-red would be better than green-black is also ok.

The main thing is that bold decisions are finally made (climate, education, immigration, the EU, the environment, etc.) and these tripple steps stop."
"117","NEUTRAL","There is only one amendment to the constitutional law that enables or better introduces a double peak (m/w or f/w) in the chancellery."
"118","NEUTRAL","Or d/d. I'm not sure about both."
"119","NEUTRAL","Many young voters simply want ‚Äúyounger‚Äù politicians too. Less because of the party program, but simply because of the feeling of being better understood.

In times of Tinder, Twitter, Instagram or Facebook etc.
and then a little nice, eco, nature and peace and finished the F4F voters.

No 18 year old chooses an Altmeier, Seehofer or whatever - and an Amthor? Sorry"
"120","NEUTRAL","I read from this that the Greens are looking for the Union. Since the Union wants to coalise with the Greens today rather than tomorrow, what belongs together grows together. FJS, Alfred Dregger would be horrified, but the Zeitgeist is now called Black Green. For the AFD, golden times begin."
"121","NEUTRAL","The Greens come very often from bourgeois families, there comes together what has belonged together"
"122","NEGATIVE","I regard the Greens as a threat to the peaceful coexistence of society, as a threat to general prosperity and as a horror to the working population. In no federal state where the Greens have ever taken responsibility, it has progressed, but has always gone downhill."
"123","POSITIVE","The other vegetables, very well put to the point. If I could forgive 1,000 hearts, you'd get them right away. üëçüëçüëçüëç"
"124","NEGATIVE","‚ÄúWe are a political force that has the task of shaping.‚Äù
How do they get that? They had 9% in the last real poll in Germany, so one in eleventh elected them in the Bundestag election. That's not much job to design. But they already deduced it from the result at that time, otherwise they would have admitted more yellow (11%) than green in the Jamaica negotiations instead of insisting on green."
"125","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúWe are a political force that has the task of shaping.‚Äù
afd."
"126","NEGATIVE","Slow down, Satan!"
"127","NEUTRAL","@LEM, but it's still a little early in the evening."
"128","POSITIVE","It is time for us to consistently end friends and acquaintances who turn to the Greens. In any case, I practice this in my circle of friends because it is incompatible with my conscience that we sacrifice our prosperity on the altar of the Greens."
"129","NEUTRAL","@Harald G. To retreat into a feel-good bladder is not a solution. Don Alphonso described it beautifully today, ‚ÄúFriends you lose for political reasons were never.‚Äù"
"130","POSITIVE","Congratulations to the re-elected leadership team. 
What I am missing personally, but perhaps I have missed the comments on how Green Protection/Protection of Species with climate protection/fight against climate change. 

I'm a logical thinking person
So if we assume fossil fuels are bad and have to be replaced ASAP, at the same time take note of the further expansion of wind power from massive resistance and solar is limited, Annalena would actually have to advertise a revival of nuclear power. No, I don't want new nuclear power plants in D, but that's not the point, it's about logical stringency.

I consider maize monocrops to be a misleading path, because of species conservation and environmental protection reasons, as well as the determination of the burning of potential food products cannot be the way.

If I look at that the air traffic contributes 2,5% is clear that you first have to reach the 30% blocks. But the discussion in recent months ran about plane and car.

I hope we see there still what of the party convention can be recalculated and in itself is logical."
"131","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúNow we no longer choose only inveterate eco‚Äù
Because they don't know what they're doing! The thick end always comes REAR. Toi, toi, toi."
"132","POSITIVE","‚ÄúNow we no longer choose only inveterate eco‚Äù
Unfortunately, this is true and above all, the young people who don't think too much about content in politics and have been abducted by climate hype, but think the duo Habeck + Baerbock is so smart and cute. But they also become adults and will recognize their error and then it will probably go down again with the Greens."
"133","NEUTRAL","@Otto,
This is certainly the case, the superficiality has increased massively up to high age regions. However, the damage that S/G has done until then is likely to be difficult to repair."
"134","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúWe are a political force that has the task of shaping.‚Äù

Of course I do. Look at the BTW result of the last election, then you see what has been granted. 

Design in the Greens means: back to the Middle Ages."
"135","POSITIVE","Fantastic result. No opposing candidates. What does that remind me of?"
"136","NEUTRAL","The party, the party... üé∂üé∂üé∂"
"137","NEUTRAL","No: You choose people who don't understand how the economy works and who don't feel at the SPD anymore."
"138","NEUTRAL","Hardly you just look at the German car industry, or the German energy industry, doesn't it understand anything about the economy? They are now implementing exactly the concepts that the Greens have been promoting for 20 years"
"139","NEGATIVE","Its main theme is the energy transition. But then statements about the possibility of storing electricity in the network? Wau and then over 90 percent approval. What gaps in knowledge do the others have?"
"140","NEUTRAL","@Katja,
do not ask about the gaps, but rather about the ones in between. There's probably not much."
"141","NEGATIVE","Only on the margins, actually quite insignificant: a large and important natural gas road from Russia to China will soon be opened."
"142","NEGATIVE","Inmeated-Eco? Aren't they all vegan? This Freudian misuse reveals the fallacy of the green policy offer. Then prefer black smoked or burnt sausage from the grill of the old (!) CDU/CSU."
"143","NEUTRAL","Let's see what's going to come. ‚ÄúIt will be 2 difficult years... O-Tone‚Äù. There's still a lot going on till then. Don't worry. The bill will be charged on election day. Then we'll see further..."
"144","NEUTRAL","The eleventh eleventh is through but I still seem a kkk question to be carnival chancellor candidate"
"145","POSITIVE","I'm glad I obviously have the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù environment. Anyway, I don't know anyone who's in a clear mind and chooses green or even left..."
"146","NEUTRAL","It happens. Those who are young and do not choose left have no heart. Whoever chooses at forty left, no mind.
There was no left-wing phase for me, but I actually know quite serious young people who I place in green - and who I am confident that this will pass."
"147","NEUTRAL","With just over 50% turnout just below 20% of the vote. Makes about 10%. Who else, besides the Inveterate Veganists, will choose the goblins, Mr. K?"
