"1","NEUTRAL","Why isn't we talking about a suspected cooperation with the United States that needed Amri's communication with Libya to bomb a terrorist camp?
In addition, Amri did not hijack the truck in Berlin, but drove over 1000 km with it from Italy to Berlin without any hassle.
Well, I'm curious if the comment is too explosive or if you bring it..."
"2","NEGATIVE","The main thing is that she's in power by 2021, no matter how. Mrs M has long been no longer interested in the protection, security and concerns of Germany. She hovers in other worlds and praises herself and her ruling in the highest tones. AM is Germany's carcinoma."
"3","NEGATIVE","The state against its own citizens...

If it weren't so sad, you'd have to laugh at it."
"4","NEUTRAL","1301of1541_16-11-2019_ 17:47 _UTC
WHERE: The decision was ‚Äúat the top‚Äù. The man reliably provided information from the Islamist milieu for years. (*1)

*1: Germany, the land of the unsuspecting?

Is there a possibility that a foreign intelligence service has influenced the federal government and, consequently, subordinate authorities? 
Interestingly, a few days later, two B2 bombers launched in the United States to spend precession weapons into a 5300 miles away North African target area. Mission accomplished.

Was the danger of an attack by Anis Amri taken into account?"
"5","NEGATIVE","It reminds us of GDR and its practices more and more of GDR. Merkel has learned a lot there and has been successfully implementing it for years. Sadly, that many Westerners do not recognize this until today and Merkel is still the most popular politician. How disinformed can a person actually be?!"
"6","NEUTRAL","I am a Westerness, and I think I've been seeing the practices of AM for a long time. Unfortunately, you are right and there are far too many to see through this lady who is in the leading position."
"7","NEGATIVE","Is it about legal disparate games or about the investigation of the assassination? Why isn't the Minister de Maiziere just summoned? And if he does not appear, he is taken in bending and handcuffed. 
A U committee has the right to do so. Why is it not used?"
"8","NEUTRAL","You know each other - who wants to hurt someone - German self-image in the year of the Mistress 2019!"
"9","NEGATIVE","So it is, we were and are stopped. The survivors have the full support of the population, they start a petition, we are there. It needs to be clarified. In such a dramatic case where 12 people died. Hint tactics so unfortunately is still governed today."
"10","NEGATIVE","We all have the right to clarify the incidents! We live in a democracy, right? Is something kept under lock? Why can't people who admitted such a thing or hinder the enlightenment be held accountable?"
"11","NEUTRAL","Agree with you on almost all points. Only democracy has this country been despiced a long time ago. This was accompanied by the simultaneous interconnection of the media."
"12","NEGATIVE","The survivors have the truly sincere compassion of the citizens. What comes from politics is hypocrisy and even poorly played. An idleness is an insult that equates to a resting night on family members."
"13","NEUTRAL","Germany is firmly under the control of the Merkel system and there is only one genuine opposition party and alternative. But it will take too long for the majority to understand that."
"14","NEUTRAL","The left will be able to do it sometime üò¨"
"15","NEGATIVE","This government is the absolute disaster. 
It has put us in a position in which we are completely incapable of action in far too many areas. If someone disagrees, he is discredited and you don't need to discuss any more because you can't talk to ‚Äúthose‚Äù as a democrat. 
It's a mourning game."
"16","NEGATIVE","Germany is like Russia or Azerbaijan or Congo... no better... completely neglecting state... 

only more coal in the system... 

but that's over when the eco communism comes."
"17","NEGATIVE","Shameful this sympathy of our...! I'll be glad when the haunts come to an end!"
"18","NEGATIVE","And then what comes, the hawk?"
"19","NEGATIVE","Probably, relatives and citizens have only learned half the truth of this inglorious story anyway. The whole thing is a scandal and again shakes my confidence in this state."
"20","POSITIVE","Thanks to the Chief of Crime. Apparently, this is the only decent among all those who have been dealing with this case from the state side so far."
"21","NEUTRAL","Mona, he probably doesn't know what he got into here - I'm curious when he cleared his desk!"
"22","NEGATIVE","Believe the ‚Äúvictim families‚Äù are not wrong as the truth is slowly coming to light. As always, Mr Seibert or his superiors hear the same thing.
NOTHING."
"23","NEUTRAL","The damagous inner minder will have followed only the instructions received from Chancellor and Chancellor's Minister of Office. 

After all, Article 65 can and may read that the ministers only follow the instructions from the Chancellery
quote

The Federal Chancellor determines the policy guidelines and bears responsibility for them. Within these guidelines, each Federal Minister manages his business unit independently and under his own responsibility. The federal government decides on disagreements between the federal ministers. The Federal Chancellor shall conduct his business in accordance with the rules of procedure adopted by the Federal Government and approved by the Federal President.

Then there's more

What else will say, Faithful"
"24","NEGATIVE","Even then, people watched speechless how quickly this act of terrorism and its victims disappeared from the media and thus public perception. While our politicians, especially Mrs Merkel, immediately demonstrated their affliction and attachment in terrorist acts abroad, the survivors of their own people had to wait a year for these signs of compassion. I can't believe it. I am convinced that they intentionally wanted to keep things small, because otherwise things would have come to light that would have harmed more than one career."
"25","NEGATIVE","It's still going on. Almost a week a knife attack, optionally an axe attack and you start to get used to the barber. Here there is a loss of values, creeping, but very threatening, and no one discusses it. On the contrary, you only hear that this has always existed, you still speak of isolated cases or of right incitement."
"26","NEGATIVE","People have been killed here, families have been destroyed, and the greasy politicians cling to their power that you can only get bad. 

At least have the decency and resign out of respect! What is this also a message to young people? ‚ÄúYou can afford everything and do not have to fear any consequences?‚Äù Great..."
"27","NEUTRAL","I mean, decency? What is it ü§î"
"28","NEGATIVE","Merkel met with the victims' families only after a year, although the state here has failed completely, I find indecent and cowardly. She must have had a very bad conscience and apparently knew more, otherwise it does not explain. This has made anger and fainting even greater among the survivors. You can make mistakes, but this indifference is bordered by betrayal, nothing else. That was also the moment when I finally turned away from this policy. On the other hand, I admire the courage of the police officers from North Rhine-Westphalia."
"29","NEUTRAL","It would be so easy to do a public hearing, for what Phoenix is for, only our politicians are being tampered by the media but are upset about the POTUS in the wide Washinton."
"30","NEGATIVE","If possible, we also look at BT sessions. The comparison with so many primary schools is not so abuding. I expressly do NOT accept any party here."
"31","NEUTRAL","After the terrorist act in Berlin, the deterrence tactics of the German government and the protection of the media were overlooked."
"32","NEUTRAL","Only yellow vests outside of Berlin help in this country.
Because in Berlin, as far as I know, people only take care of themselves.
Even if it is called the Federal Republic of Germany, it should be called the Republic of Berlin.
Because grand coalition bows red-red-green under Merkel, with all its consequences"
"33","NEUTRAL","Politics are everyone today, and everyone does not care about anyone.
Saying Voltaire, I think"
"34","NEUTRAL","The country finally needs independent prosecutors!
The German Confederation of Judges has been demanding this since 2003 and it is EU standard.
This is where Mr Steinmeier could contribute positively to Germany."
"35","NEUTRAL","Honestly, would they do the job? with Family? with threat of? where everyone can go where they live? or her way to work? I can understand why one or the other judgement is made, whether it is not that you have lost it with the government or NGO or out of fear of influential penalties 
I don't know how? 
Judgments in the name of the people with oppressed identity 
 possibly on behalf of the Chamber consisting of xy judges and on the prosecution is the prosecutor's office xy without the name of the prosecution prosecutor 
08/15 (under closing)"
"36","NEUTRAL","The errors had already begun in North Rhine-Westphalia. No one wants that to be true anymore, neither here. Interior Minister J√§ger, North Rhine-Westphalia, along with Hannelore Kraft had the responsibility. Plus the Ausl√§nderbeh√∂rde in Kleve, which made one mistake after another - instruction to the AG Ravensburg, release Amri, residence cover, warnings from Tunisia, Italy etc... I still saved everything."
"37","NEUTRAL","Do you also save? We're also druxking, with copies."
"38","NEUTRAL","As far as recalled, two of the assassins on the Bataclan in Paris with 130 dead via Greece, Serbia and Germany - thanks to the open borders - arrived in France in October 2015. 
The borders that Mrs Merkel has opened do not only affect Germany."
"39","NEUTRAL","Macr√∂nchen doesn't seem to care, there's nothing but love between them."
"40","NEUTRAL","One wonders what is still buried in the basement in Berlin. It is time to work on the government's work over the last 16 years - interrogating all the ministers, officials and chancellors involved."
"41","NEUTRAL","if I look at what accusations the AFD has to deal with, possibly rightly, then I am in favour of a review since 1950 with the CDU and others, your statements, 
their members, their ‚Äúcorpses‚Äù buried in bonn and berlin"
"42","NEGATIVE","I just can't trust this federal government anymore."
"43","NEGATIVE","I wonder what about the other survivors murdered by assassins. Have they been silenced by our government? I can't imagine you're not mad at our government. After all, all these crimes would not happen if our politicians were to do their work properly and responsibly."
"44","NEUTRAL","Two years ago, the ARD was a report, ‚ÄúThe Second Life: The Forgotten Victims of Terrorist Attacks‚Äù. It's still on yt. Take a look at these. In addition to survivors from Breitscheidplatz, survivors of attacks on German tourists abroad are also shown. 
A shocking document how disinterested the local administration is about the dead, injured and survivors."
"45","NEGATIVE","With all criticism of the inability of the government and law enforcement authorities, it should not be forgotten what was the cause."
"46","NEGATIVE","Another coffin nail in the direction of ‚ÄúGermany is getting away‚Äù

Songs this happens - incomprehensibly - with full consciousness...!? How can that be?"
"47","NEGATIVE","Many have already done mentally...
20% are awake, 20% benefit from the system and defend it, 60% are dull or hope for God."
"48","NEGATIVE","... the necessary and ‚Äútimely‚Äù information is dismissed... and at the end of the legislature the committee of inquiry is dissolved... this government is unbearable... elects this government... the chairman of the Legal Committee of the Bundestag has also been done... just like that..."
"49","POSITIVE","We can do this!"
"50","NEGATIVE","It's kept something under the lid, nobody admits it, no one is held accountable. Because something has happened in this state that is or has been suggested to us that is not allowed or allowed to happen. Surveillance, control obversation nothing works! Where is the protection for citizens. My pity for the survivors who ask for reconnaissance and deserve to know!"
"51","NEGATIVE","For me, this means a state failure in all areas, Mrs Merkel is now back in cover!!! Nothing seen, nothing heard! Mrs Merkel is responsible for this terrorist attack that de Maizi√®re and Mrs Merkel could have prevented these violent murders of 12 people."
"52","NEGATIVE","Unfortunately, the 12 are only the tip of the iceberg. 
Even if the opposite party likes to argue something like this, there has always been - which is true - it is not possible to deny that the decision of 2015 will increase the absolute figures. We live in the safest Germany of all time - may be the same. However, it would be even safer if 2015 had not taken place like this. 
The saddest thing about it - it can no longer be undone."
"53","NEGATIVE","Alexander F. 3 hours ago

‚ÄúBelieve me, this is not incompetence. This is deliberate and targeted disinformation towards a people that their own government is afraid of.‚Äù

This fear seems to be huge: 10 m wide and 2.50 m deep, filled with water, in front of the Bundestag. Cost point approx. 100 million ‚Ç¨

Start of construction still unclear."
"54","NEGATIVE","My sincere sympathy to the relatives of the victims. This state is shameful."
"55","POSITIVE","Interior Minister J√§ger and Hannelore Kraft had the responsibility. Plus the Ausl√§nderbeh√∂rde in Kleve, which made one mistake at a time - order to release AG Ravensburg, Amri. I still saved everything."
"56","NEGATIVE","The Berlin Constitutional Protection has failed at least as much.
The BKA and, which I am not surprised, with regard to other ‚Äúachievements‚Äù De Maizieres, also as Minister of Defence, also the Minister of the Interior, has in any case not had any crap on work since 2015 anyway.

Or why a year later there wasn't even enough equipment to have fingerprints of all newcomers? And this is just an example of the continuous failure at the very top. Also I have saved a list."
"57","NEGATIVE","Not only the behaviour of politicians, but also the media, is shameful towards the victims of Breitscheidplatz and their families, if one compares the extent to which (rightly) responded by all sides during the attack in Halle..."
"58","NEUTRAL","In Halle, fast offerings were more important than the actual victims..."
"59","NEUTRAL","It seems that ‚Äúrelentless education and absolute transparency‚Äù is taking place."
"60","NEGATIVE","The main thing is live ticker and breaking news about the impeachment trial against the hated Trump. This is much more important... You have to imagine this: even in the news of Klassik-Radio it is reported. When did anyone ever hear about the committee of inquiry on radio news? Well... there's nothing to report about it, because everything's going to be on the sand anyway. I sincerely feel sorry for the survivors of the victims. I hope they don't run out of strength to call for answers. Very unworthy everything."
"61","NEGATIVE","And then politicians get upset when Brandner notes that candles are ‚Äúrumling‚Äù at crime scenes instead of taking care of the necessary measures?
But, strangely enough, this is always the case with our responsible politicians, generously announcing that unbureaucratic aid will be provided quickly and then nothing will be done. Whether flood damage, assassination or amoc flows. Cry out and suspected culprits quickly to the ‚Äúpillory‚Äù and afterwards dive or deny themselves. Bad behavior of responsible politicians, unfortunately."
"62","NEGATIVE","Has anyone ever thought that these and other attacks are approved by politics!? 
This means that more and more reasons to enact new laws that allow more and more close control of the population!?"
"63","NEGATIVE","You think too far... it's not enough for our government."
"64","NEGATIVE","I have no confidence in a U committee as if the summoned people were telling the truth, or one would really be interested in a resolution (since Van der Leyen). Rather, a prosecutor's investigation proceeding brings results."
"65","NEGATIVE","Something is rotten in the State of Germany."
"66","NEUTRAL","Just because a commissioner claims something doesn't have to be true."
"67","NEGATIVE","right or wrong? 
Why does he do that? because he wants to win elections? 
because he wants to go to the media? 
or because it is enough for him to have it swept under all the carpets and possibly become? 
what did he davon-I ask you?"
"68","NEGATIVE","The reconnaissance was put into the sand with the rapid deportation of the alleged accomplice! Unfortunately there was a deportation very fast, almost already hastily!"
"69","NEUTRAL","Suspension and lifting of the immunity of all parties involved, including the BK, could help to complete clarification."
"70","NEGATIVE","Shameful"
"71","NEUTRAL","why is it not reported about the presumably two helpers and their coma victims?"
"72","NEUTRAL","Well, it is, of course, a truism that politicians are never to blame for anything. We know that from Pilate."
"73","NEGATIVE","For attacks abroad, Merkel reliably condoles on the same day.
But if something like this happens on her doorstep, it takes almost a year for a reaction.

It would have excited me in the past, now I think 87% want that and other things just like that."
"74","NEGATIVE","And not only in this terrorist attack, she showed this indifference. After all, she is honest and clearly demonstrates lack of empathy. If so many voters want to identify with it, they get exactly what they deserve."
"75","NEGATIVE","If you think that a zu Guttenberg had to take his hat because of a moderated doctoral thesis and who here remain stuck to their posts despite such processes as the proverbial dog-pile on the shoe then you can only get sick."
"76","NEGATIVE","The whole thing is a scandal of special kind. I just remind you that Merkel sent letters of condolence to the survivors far too late after media pressure. First they got these bills from the morgue."
"77","NEGATIVE","That's the same thing with the politicians every time.
Pity, immediate help and complete reconnaissance are promised, and as soon as the cameras are off, everything is forgotten."
"78","NEGATIVE","unbearable this whole Shitstorm - best you are all quite calm - that would be measured..."
"79","NEUTRAL","Who do you mean?"
"80","MIXED","The accusation of the victim families is justified the action of politics makes it more than clear. The decisions made will be defended by all means as right. The answers that politicians give to this day are poor. The worst part is that we accept it."
"81","NEGATIVE","And I'm waiting for everything else to happen so you can't take it anymore."
"82","NEGATIVE","As if the invited politicians are burdening themselves... I'm afraid I don't expect anything from such a committee. Well, you'd better get the DA's office."
"83","NEUTRAL","Does' Berlin 'even want a complete reconnaissance??"
"84","NEGATIVE","The investigation of the assassination is a single disaster. The compensation of the affected families took a long time, including psychological support for police, fire brigade and medical personnel."
"85","NEUTRAL","Nothing can surprise or surprise you with this federal government. And stopping and delaying are two typical features of their ‚Äúmode of operation‚Äù - almost their mode operandi."
"86","NEGATIVE","The stopping and delaying could also have to do with the fact that, in addition to Maiziere, other very high politicians knew about this process shortly after the terrorist attack!"
"87","NEUTRAL","For me, it is clear that the `non-affected citizens` people who have nothing to do with these migrants are generally tolerant (according to their understanding).
It would be tolerant to look at the situation not only from one's own perspective.
It would be tolerant to present the situation from the point of view of `affected. '
For example, from the point of view of old people who don't go for a walk in the evening. 
From the point of view of pupils and young people who are oppressed by migrants.
From the point of view of shopkeepers who stole the goods (without reaction of the judiciary)
From the point of view of women who are a welcome gift for the mostly young men from other cultural circles.
From the point of view of those who are looking for an apartment and find that the newcomers simply get one.
I'm curious, whether the editorial office published my assessment or whether the whole is already outside the speakable again."
"88","NEUTRAL","The federal government, responsible for incidents like this, certainly has a great interest in education."
"89","NEGATIVE","The basis of government behaviour is hard and freezing considerations for self-protection."
"90","POSITIVE","Then Bachmann and de Maiziere will soon be on the committee of inquiry, which will be exciting."
"91","NEUTRAL","de Maizi√®re must appear, but can use a right of refusal (if he, for example, expose himself to prosecution by his testimony), Bachmann does not have to appear at all."
"92","NEUTRAL","So the Interior Ministry denies the testimony of the witness, according to ARD Tagesschau."
"93","NEUTRAL","What did they expect except deny, deny, deny?"
"94","NEGATIVE","Abstract at the ballot box, everything else leads to nothing."
"95","NEGATIVE","@ Fritz! How many times have we hoped for an 'abstraction'? And even if it was' punished ', the' punished 'sit in the government!"
"96","NEGATIVE","The incompetence of our state bodies is terrifying. Why do you have informants if you don't believe them? I feel sorry for the survivors..."
"97","NEGATIVE","Believe me, this is not incompetence. This is deliberate and targeted disinformation towards a people that their own government is afraid of."
"98","MIXED","Well, we didn't see that coming. 
We can't help it. 

That's all going to happen. 
My compassion is for the survivors, my contempt for those responsible."
"99","NEUTRAL","Has the WORLD not learned anything from Kassel? Here such a blue rush is driven that it is not far from the FB Postings via L√ºbcke. Perhaps the agenda incitement of some groups should be considered in more detail."
"100","NEGATIVE","What exactly disturbs you when WELT reports on these new findings and revelations that may indicate a scandalous misconduct of the people involved (including the Interior Minister)? WELT only reports about it! Or, in your opinion, is the Chief Crime Commissioner doing ‚Äúbruises‚Äù (what a newword; -.) when he simply makes his statements about it? The victims' members certainly disagree with your view of things, so much is clear!"
"101","NEGATIVE","I remember a quote from the police. It was said that surveillance was stopped because it was assumed that he was just an ordinary drug trafficker.
It was also known that he had several (14) identities. 
I imagine I'd be accused of this. I'm sure I'll be in jail within a few hours.
Not only the Minister of the Interior at that time belongs to court, but also others who covered such behavior."
"102","NEUTRAL","The same behavior as after New Year's Eve and all the other events. If every time they were taken consistently and those responsible were held accountable, there would not be such conditions either."
"103","NEGATIVE","A horrible event that is remembered to hear now that it could be prevented, I'm talking. What's going on in Germany, unbelievable!"
"104","NEUTRAL","How do you think, uh, make it!"
"105","NEUTRAL","The reaction to the terrorist attack on the Christmas market in Berlin reveals further curiosities: only one year after the attack and only after strong public pressure, German Chancellor Merkel found herself prompted to contact the victims' families in person; no member of the Federal government; names and life stories of the victims, partly foreign tourists, are kept in the background. Obviously, too much emotional identification with the victims is to be prevented. Why?"
"106","NEGATIVE","Because Merkel invited these people! She has never been able to make a public statement: we have enough asylum seekers here and the next two years are not allowed to go in!"
"107","MIXED","Always the same.
Tonight grow up and then go to sleep again.
I praise the French, they're not duckmicks."
"108","NEUTRAL","We choose the AfD here is colder than in France"
"109","NEUTRAL","The federal government just did not want to worry the population unnecessarily. In the case of the victims and their survivors, one can assume that they were the wrong victims when one sees what else can be done if there are other victims. The time that passed until the Chancellor felt at all eager and what one agrees in this case to the victims and survivors on the part of the government is hardly to be surpassed in misery."
"110","NEGATIVE","Pathetic. Exactly the right description of the reaction of our leaders"
"111","NEGATIVE","Always the same.
Discourse narrowing due to euphemisms, Merkel's travel abroad, delays, no reports, devote press, etc.
It can't be what can't be."
"112","NEUTRAL","but the survivors should stick primarily with their criticism, to the state criminalamt/Polpras. of berlin and to the senate before shooting again towards the federal government.
the main responsibility is and remains a matter of the country, even if that should not please the relatives!
It is the senate of the Berlin, who has broken down since taking office of wowereit, police and fire brigade."
"113","NEUTRAL","Who opened the borders?"
"114","NEGATIVE","Unfortunately, in the meantime, this seems to be a legitimate matter for the rulers only to report to the people what is desirable for the rulers. So in this case."
"115","NEGATIVE","We see here again how we are dominated, it does not matter whether advisory af√§ren or case amri, they are set above the
And who believes and lives a democracy...
The man is wrong"
"116","NEUTRAL","Tobias, if I could I give you 2 points"
"117","POSITIVE","9/11, Nice, Berlin. Questions, questions and no answers. You go over..."
"118","NEUTRAL","This is the same way as with the tax victors who were put cold because it became explosive for some elites"
"119","NEGATIVE","If we then consider the untenable facts of the Turkish murders, the files have disappeared and in the Amri case of the BND always knew what he was doing, I think first of all of the state terrorism"
"120","NEUTRAL","Would they go that far?"
"121","NEUTRAL","Will turn on the Tagesschau today after just over 4 years, I'm curious if the topic will be. After all, it was just a regional event..."
"122","NEUTRAL","In doubt, today's federal government is not on the side of its own population...

That's what it looks like..."
"123","NEGATIVE","Oh, that might cause us to worry. I read about it yesterday and this is indeed an absolute case of hardship. These people could all be alive. Now I also know why the Minister of the Interior was so fast away from the window. Just sad."
"124","NEUTRAL","Is that something new...
There is always a promise of comprehensive education...
That's the first lie..."
"125","NEGATIVE","Do we have to talk about cover-up attempts now? I ask myself this question seriously when I think of everything that comes out in a disc. Reminds fatally of other operations."
"126","NEGATIVE","The abysses that open up here and appear to come from the very top are hardly in the way that a troubled population of a changing country has been calmed down with phrase-threshing - do this, not in my power, no longer my country and much more. 
With the important difference that the victims and their relatives unfortunately had to experience the consequences of these abysses. That's very sad."
"127","NEUTRAL","@Susanne G.
That's not ‚Äúvery sad.‚Äù The adjectives quoted by the survivors are more likely to be met. These are already drastically but still extremely chosen."
"128","NEGATIVE","Why are those responsible not held accountable?

We are scolding about autocracies, but the German government is now also traversed by criminal energy.

Shameful."
"129","NEGATIVE","Why?
Because the German would rather let off steam in online forums than on the street.
In France, it would have been rambling..."
"130","NEUTRAL","See if we hear about this in the TV evening main news. My fear, however, is that Trump will fill the whole time without asking."
"131","NEGATIVE","If this is confirmed then the responsible politicians are behind bars!"
"132","NEUTRAL","I am still missing the committee of inquiry promised by the FDP on government behaviour in 2015 as a whole."
"133","NEUTRAL","This demand was before the election. All proposals in this direction came from the only real opposition."
"134","NEGATIVE","Only good that he ‚Äúfled ‚Äúto Italy, I don't like to imagine if he had been caught in Germany"
"135","NEUTRAL","yes, then he would probably be a German citizen and at large."
"136","NEGATIVE","Why is such a statement not known until three years after the attack? The official would have had ways to pass on this information long before the Committee of Inquiry was set up.

I do not understand at all why it takes years for a parliamentary committee of inquiry to be constituted on such an important matter."
"137","NEGATIVE","I'm sure the official was afraid for his job
(Muzzle) Who can prove total failure to his supreme superior?"
"138","NEUTRAL","Why are the lambs silent?"
"139","NEUTRAL","Because there are more important issues such as climate."
"140","NEGATIVE","And is Merkel now quickly going abroad again? Do it always when it gets uncomfortable for their incapable federal government."
"141","POSITIVE","I would like to thank the Chief of Crime Commissioner and the police officers from North Rhine-Westphalia for their dare to provide uncomfortable answers. You know they're not just making friends with it."
"142","NEGATIVE","Now I know why the Lutz Bachmann immediately knew who the killer was after the attack. Everyone immediately thought that was the Amri. No one has taken care of the relatives of the victims from the high politicians. Because of their failure, no one could look in the eyes of the victims and relatives."
"143","NEGATIVE","What can't be, can't be. We can't control the whole boundaries.. oh, Merkel is still highly praised and she has so so much screwed up."
"144","NEUTRAL","The Federal Government knows much more in this case, it just does not want to unsettle us, but I - we - want to know the truth."
"145","NEUTRAL","Stefan Schubert wrote and talked about it extensively..."
