"1","NEGATIVE","With these serious mistakes, he probably shot himself into the ‚ÄúOFF‚Äù... how long is there to be rummaged around, that no one understands anymore..."
"2","NEGATIVE","For some time (2015/2017), all ministers have a protection status. Only in order to maintain Groko's survival, anyone can afford the biggest carvers without anything happening. Even the boss has this protection status. Also the ex-Defense Minister.

Just stay calm, we'll make it until the next election."
"3","NEGATIVE","The man belongs immediately dismissed, without further remuneration and with his private property held liable."
"4","NEGATIVE","Yeah, that kind of stupid!"
"5","NEUTRAL","The CSU shines in series with miscasts. Only last week Scheuer shone with a ‚Äúbig litter‚Äù at the ‚ÄúDigital Exam‚Äù, while another CSU luminary, Dorothea B√§hr as a highly paid ‚ÄúMinister of State for Digitalization‚Äù, has not been heard for months. I can't believe what kind of staff is being sent from Bavaria to Berlin."
"6","NEGATIVE","‚ÄúIn the award, the Ministry had negotiated with the remaining bidder about its final offer without giving the other bidders the opportunity to make a new offer, criticised the Court of Auditors. In addition, the report submitted to the dpa news agency states that 'there was no sufficient budgetary authorisation' at the time of conclusion of the contract. '

The laws and regulations do not have much importance for our ladies and gentlemen of politics, is nothing new. Nevertheless, Mr Scheuer must stand straight for this and resign his office. In addition, a corresponding penalty should be followed."
"7","MIXED","Adviser costs for his other project of 100 thousand he has already shot, he does not take it so with the tax money. 

By the way, for 100 million, I'm all you want. Except competent."
"8","NEUTRAL","A ‚Äúmille‚Äù is a thousand. 100 thousand is 100 thousand.
Not 100 million."
"9","NEGATIVE","I still don't understand why politicians who deal with taxpayers' money are not retreated with their private assets. If an employee would afford such a thing, he would have to expect that he will be taken into recourse with his private assets. It cannot be that politicians deal with the taxpayer's money as if it were hers."
"10","NEGATIVE","In every good company, a board committing such misconduct at his resort must expect his kick out and answer for infidelity in court.
 Nothing happens here and the ‚ÄúCEO‚Äù is watching without action."
"11","NEUTRAL","Andreas Scheuer is still in office.
What does the Chancellor say?
I was sure it couldn't get any worse to Dobrindt.
I was wrong.
Due to deliberate fraud and embezzlement of state assets, the prosecutor's office should intervene."
"12","NEGATIVE","Neither shame nor guilt. Actually, a pathological case, this man."
"13","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúIn addition, ‚Äúthere was no sufficient budgetary authorization at the time of conclusion of the contract,‚Äù says the report ‚Äú
In plain text: no legal protection = legally relevant. That's how I understand it as a layman. It won't tantate him, though. It's just like always."
"14","NEGATIVE","Once again, 'The German Volke' showed that politics currently has no inhibitions and no conscience. 

Politicians would have to be punished as much for tax evasion as citizens would have to be punished for tax evasion. At least Scheuer should be dismissed his retirement benefits. That would be the least. And, of course, the immediate dismissal. But within the Union, unfortunately, there will be no such thing. Too bad for all citizens."
"15","NEUTRAL","Bernhard, not just the scouring!"
"16","NEGATIVE","In a company or a privately controlled environment, there would only be immediate resignation.
Every new day with this minister is a day too much"
"17","NEGATIVE","It's lucky he's not from the Afd. Well, then something's going on."
"18","NEGATIVE","Please resign or be removed.
How many millions of euros has Mr Scheuer thrown out of the window through his lack of knowledge.
Another minister who has absolutely no idea of his field."
"19","NEGATIVE","And how many thousands of euros does he get transferred to his account monthly as a penalty?"
"20","NEUTRAL","Total political failure without political consequences.
Crows among themselves.
Meanwhile, I take all this without complaint. 
Because this state is the will to vote."
"21","NEUTRAL","That's right. This is precisely why the CSU was chosen among other things. The toll was great for many. Although at that time it was already clear that she would pay little money."
"22","NEGATIVE","If you look at the results of the burned millions in the ministries, you can only speak of money thrown out. What would have come out if the elected had despiced themselves? I'd rather not."
"23","POSITIVE","But introduce a Bon duty."
"24","NEUTRAL","If the GREEN demands this to the Oath of office concerning Scheurer, this must also apply to the Federal Chancellor.

For what was Article 3 (1) of the Basic Law
All men are equal before the law.

So equal right for everyone, but laws can change and interpret as you like, but if you have a constitution, it is more difficult"
"25","NEUTRAL","Who is the Federal Audit Court, the financial controllers do not seriously believe that they will do anything against a CSU minister and the ministry run by him. Scheuer wouldn't even let the Federal Constitutional Court say anything. The man wears Teflon suits with automatic flap when he sits on his chair."
"26","NEGATIVE","You can gradually not do it in politics anymore that you only choose people according to proportions or any Amigo criteria. It is simply no longer possible that a politician who knows nothing about the subject can simply become a minister. 
Thus, politics makes itself ridiculous and superfluous. There must be more experts in politics, the qualification must become the top selection crierium. Even if it leads to having to take one who doesn't have a party book."
"27","NEUTRAL","And what's happening now? Consequences?"
"28","NEGATIVE","It resigns with monthly references that I can only dream of. But it's his own fault. Punishment must be."
"29","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúIn addition, at the time of conclusion of the contract, ‚Äúdid not have sufficient budgetary authorization‚Äù‚Äù

Abuse of office. 
Who's accused of criminal law?
The minister is no longer durable."
"30","NEGATIVE","The patriot and combustion and diesel engine fetishist Scheuer simply does not have the format for a minister. He's just too... to that. His predecessor wasn't much smarter either. What kind of staff does the CSU have? It's horrible. 
But now the scouring is due."
"31","NEGATIVE","In these cases, isn't the interest in action as great as in the new SEK tax search force?
Everyone else gets fired directly if they can afford a thing like that.
In the civil service and are undertaken training topic anti-corruption.
Especially applies to the lower wage groups, which are not allowed to accept allowances over ‚Ç¨15 in total."
"32","NEGATIVE","It's a pity that the CSU does not compete nationwide, it would immediately fall below 20%."
"33","NEUTRAL","This will not itch him warmly, as always, if specifically CSulers have no idea what they are doing. As long as he does not have to be liable with his private property, the taxpayer is allowed to bathe it again."
"34","NEGATIVE","Obviously, Scheuer has unlawfully awarded public contracts to companies favored by him without an orderly tender and has ensured that, after the toll debacle, lukratrive compensation is incurred for them. Spezlwirtschft at the finest...
Man does not belong to the Ministerial Bank, but to the dock!"
"35","NEGATIVE","The Bundesrechungshof is also just a toothless tiger. For ages, violations and offenses have been pointed out and warned, but the polluters are not even threatened with a warning. In this respect, the Bundesrechungshof is also just an authority that can basically be closed down because it burns money unnecessarily."
"36","NEGATIVE","The Federal Audit Court is constantly admonishing something!
The problem is that there are no consequences at all!!
I wonder if here is only reported so that you can say afterwards you have warned it..."
"37","NEUTRAL","infringement before...

against which one more? Is the Federal Audit Court accusing these legal proceedings within the last 10 years? 
Thank you for the info."
"38","POSITIVE","After the good GroKo mid-term review..."
"39","NEUTRAL","In the disability ranking, Scheuer should be just behind V.d.Leyen."
"40","NEGATIVE","No, he's already overtaken her. I could bite the table with anger because we have to pay for this incompetence. The taxpayers always have to reach when the money is simply sunk."
"41","NEUTRAL","And now? Ignore and continue as before... üò§"
"42","NEGATIVE","Ministers have already resigned because of Peanuts. This fine gentleman must probably be tried until he realizes that he is a total miscast."
"43","POSITIVE","You'll have to carry it out."
"44","NEGATIVE","If that happens right away, I don't mind. He's not up to the job, my impression."
"45","NEUTRAL","In order to be able to dismiss the Minister, Mrs Merkel would still have to be able to act and willing in some way. There's been no talk of that for a long time. Responsible action for the country? No need for a person. However, any man of honor would have resigned on his own accord."
"46","NEUTRAL","It wouldn't have existed under AH."
"47","NEGATIVE","Basically, politicians are resistant to counselling, all the more my lack of understanding for the horrendous advisory fees and those still partly without consideration (see Transport Minister Scheuer)."
"48","NEUTRAL","One should think that the German system requires the signature of any supervisory body before the final award of contracts of this magnitude (Ministry of Finance? Justice? Bundestag presidium?). Does anyone know how the process works? And if anyone slept there?"
"49","NEUTRAL","What I still do not understand: is there now or is there not a ‚Äúentry into force clause‚Äù stating that the Treaties enter into force only on the day when the ECJ gives the green light? If no, then there can only be one thing: the Minister's resignation and a few heads have to roll in the ministry as well, because to rely only on the abolition of the business basis, that would be very unlegal.

Another question would be how to deal with the time in between, from the conclusion of the contract, presumably a few days after the positive vote of the Advocate General to the ECJ. If services have already been provided by mutual agreement, that may be fine, and that is a risk assessment.

Am I too simple to knit?"
"50","NEGATIVE","At the latest, it is over with arrogant arrogance of the Minister of Transport. If the CSU does not want to take serious damage, it should force him to resign. This minister is a danger. He can't do anything (advisory fees) and so far appears to be obscure. The best thing to do is to devote the entire government. They just don't create their goals."
"51","NEGATIVE","Every worker in this country, our country, has more responsibility, because he has to stand straight for his mistakes."
"52","POSITIVE","Our assistants will know what to do in the morning. Our boss chooses very well and pays accordingly well."
"53","NEGATIVE","I just hope that this minister will continue until the next election!

So anti-advertising for this coalition and be party. 

Thank you, Andy."
"54","NEUTRAL","Andreas Scheuer is, from my point of view, an extreme problem; from a political, character, habitual and intellectual point of view."
"55","NEUTRAL","Not the only one... or do I see this wrong (question to co-commentators)?

Greetings"
"56","NEGATIVE","Ten years ago, that would be the reason for a resignation for moral reasons... Oh, yeah. Why did Br√ºderle resign? This, of course, has been much more serious than Scheurer's tax money waste. However, he would resign, and half the government would have to resign, including various state politicians."
"57","NEUTRAL","Br√ºderle did not resign because of any misconduct or affairs, but because he became chairman of the group.
Rudolf Seiters was such a case that resigned because others made mistakes and he (without any real reason) sincerely assumed political responsibility for it."
"58","NEGATIVE","So what? For this government, a few million of the hard-working population who are being put on the sand alone for the ego of individuals (especially CSU ministers) are now really irrelevant. So please - your auditor, please not so petty!"
"59","NEGATIVE","Like all other ‚Äúscandals‚Äù, this will be done in the sand without any human consequences...
Anybody want to bet?"
"60","NEUTRAL","When will this rather imperceptible ‚Äúminister‚Äù finally dismissed
 without remuneration, and also held accountable for its mismanagement.??
 His skills are used in Bavaria, 
Hopefully, an adequate cheaper alternative will be found in the EU in good time before anyone comes up with the idea of praising him away."
"61","NEUTRAL","A minister of any other party would have long since resigned. Of course, the CSU has different standards."
"62","NEUTRAL","See Franz-Josef Strauss"
"63","NEGATIVE","I think it's high time Mr. Scheuer to deprive the ministry and immunity.
the Lord shall be held accountable for the damage he has caused.
It cannot and must not be that such guys get away again and again."
"64","POSITIVE","I agree with that too."
