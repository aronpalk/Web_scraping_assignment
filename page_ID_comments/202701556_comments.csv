"1","NEUTRAL","World author Tim Röhn wrote down why he feels with the refugees — and why the borders have to be closed. An excerpt:

“If not, then things have to change quickly, then things have to be called by name: those who have the necessary money, and the strong — they make it to us. But these are not the ones who suffer the most.

In addition, asylum centres at the EU's external borders should be set up promptly, where asylum applications are already thoroughly pre-examined. In addition to combating the causes of escape, there is finally a need for more legal routes to Europe. If we better control who comes to us, then we can much more help those who actually need help. People forget at the gates of the continent — this must not happen.”

"2","NEUTRAL","There have always been economic refugees, migration consists only to a small extent of direct fleeing war, in essence people flee from economic distress or because of the oppression by a totalitarian system. The US almost certainly consists of such people.
What do we learn from this? If we really want to reduce migration, then we must help countries to control their economies, that is, we must put pressure on political leadership, in which there is only economic aid if the aid is implemented in education and basic economies, so that the economy in the population develops. and as a result everyone gets work. The underdeveloped areas cannot start with high-tech, but simple work is needed. Then people do not push into the cities and form slums, but develop the country from below and form a basis for a stable economy.
The next effect is that the growth of the population is diminishing and entails a huge step towards reducing the growth of energy consumption and thus increasing CO2.
After all, if these people want to achieve our prosperity and energy consumption, then we have to limit our comfort enormously."
"3","NEUTRAL","Today's message: https://www.welt.de/regionales/nrw/article203330038/Schwarzfahrer-mit-fuenf-Identitaeten-verletzt-Polizisten.html?wtrid=kooperation.reco.taboola.free.welt.desktop

Wanted to write “We can do this”, but again there was no comment field."
"4","POSITIVE","This excellent series documents the failure of the Federal Government and the Federal Chancellor. In fact, even more so, the failure of the political system in Germany, including public media, associations and NGOs. What is astonishing is that, despite this fact, Mrs Merkel and her government are still in office. And it is also surprising that the majority of the population in Germany still do not want to take note of this failure. Obviously, the collective delusion that Germany can save the world through self-abandonment or overstrain and at the same time wash itself away from historical guilt is too tempting, or the fear of being placed in the far-right camp. But on the day that one is exposed as a big fraud and the other as a clumsy diversion, no one wants to have been. And by the way, despite these morally driven misdevelopments with massive consequences for Germany, the situation in the countries of origin of migrants has not improved any further. Say, there's more."
"5","POSITIVE","Excellent, ideology-free documentation by an outstanding journalist. Information, careful research rather than “attitude”. Thank you very much, Stefan Aust."
"6","POSITIVE","Dear Mr. Aust, dear Mr. Büchel,

Thank you very much for this informative series. There's a lot of work in it.

This brings me directly to the subject: our politicians are making it too easy as they are putting more and more on us. The chaos also had an impact on my work and I wish to return to normal. I do a lot for refugees, and for some I can understand why they are here. However, her behavior is very annoying to me. That someone really fits in our country, with our mentality is very rare. It's more like we have to adapt to them, and it costs energy that you actually need for other things.

The moment Merkel said to Anne Will, “And now I may want to make it clear again that it is not in my power, it is not at all in the power of any person from Germany, how many people come to us”, shocked me.

To me, it sounds like we're being totally foreigned, having no influence, everything doesn't matter. The situation is depressing me. This chancellor is pointing infinitely, and I can't see her anymore. She's lying in the country like lead. 

At first I was still active, helped in the AfD. But like many others, I retired again, because the hostility against the AfD became worse and this was even more annoying. You don't really have the opportunity to get involved. You eat it in yourself.

It's only recently that I've seen people just talk about the subject. People are very upset and many are going to choose the AfD next time. There fall terms such as “party dictatorship”. People I had assigned to the welcome faction turned their mind completely. That's the only thing that gives me hope right now."
"7","NEGATIVE","The main cause of escape is the smuggers, and organised crime behind it. Finally, we need a consistent fight against the smugglers and those lawbreakers who cooperate with them."
"8","NEGATIVE","When I read the article, it seems like a bad dream to me. The fact that our government made such unspeakable decisions and then even if the error remained on track will not only leave me a lasting loss of confidence. At some point, the realization prevailed that everything was actually wanted. Just why? The answer is simple and still a catatverse.
In 2011, the German government's demographic report stated that Germany needs a net migration of 400000 migrants every year to keep the number of army personnel at the current level. The following is the sentence: immigration of skilled workers of this magnitude cannot be obtained. 
The Bundesbank has calculated what will become of the German economy without immigration and came to the conclusion that the qualification of the little educated and the costs resulting from immigration into social systems are more favourable than a decline in economic power due to a lack of labour. So we can choose between bad luck or cholera."
"9","NEGATIVE","This reportage and the book “Die Drierten” by Robin Alexander show the unimaginable irresponsible action or non-action of Mrs. Merkel and her black-red government apparatus. Many have paid for this with your life. How hypocritical is the insulting of the AFD in the Bundestag and the whining and complaining that the AFD received about 25% of the votes in the last state elections. I, too, find it intolerable that a Mr Höcke celebrates such successes with his extreme right-wing attitude - but the fault is personally borne by Mrs Merkel and your ministers. She seems to me like a car driver who has driven her car against the wall at full throttle, despite many warning signs and hints - and now insults the brake pedal in loud anger attacks, which she did not want to step on as a responsible driver."
"10","NEUTRAL","There is also a summary:
The conservative French newspaper Le Figaro commented [2017] on the responsibility of the Chancellor for the success of the AfD:
“Your new victory even has a bitter taste. The chancellor's place in the history books is stained by the historical result of the AfD populists. Their migration policy, coupled with the alliance with the SPD, has given this result to the extreme right (...). “Mummy” has become the “mother of the AFD”. “

"11","NEUTRAL","One wonders why certain politicians are still in their offices and not long ago in prison, as oath breakers."
"12","NEUTRAL","A few days ago, Norway announced that it would no longer support its migrants financially. It's already worked, the numbers are falling.
The problem can be solved so easily. 

But there must be very bad Nazis in Oslo at the government"
"13","NEGATIVE","Another Germany... 

Not my Germany!"
"14","NEUTRAL","Germany is abolishing itself. Whether consciously or unconsciously. The END result does not matter."
"15","NEGATIVE","Germany has not yet managed to cope with the consequences of this massive immigration - far too long waiting times for asylum procedures, procrastination and x possibilities for objection (it has developed its own “professional division” or NGO platform), hundreds of thousands of rejected asylum seekers remain in Germany - without consequences, massive immigration into social systems, further strengthening of already overpresent parallel societies, increase in crime, gang clans,...! And the bad thing about it is that there are still political parties (left and left Greens) who want to further promote this political-social madness! Merkel and the majority of the CDU have not yet understood this and continue to open the gates! Unbelievable and incapable, in short!"
"16","NEGATIVE","A chronicle whose reading is difficult and leaves a very oppressive feeling. What will later historians write about this delusion that has invaded this country and large parts of its inhabitants?"
"17","NEGATIVE","The same megalomania as in the Third Reich, only with a different focus. A people who are mentally disturbed in the collective"
"18","POSITIVE","Thank you for this honest and open summary."
"19","NEGATIVE","A worse Germany on the way to become even worse. Thanks to Merkel and an incompetent CDU who does not manage to get rid of her. Then you have to dodge alternatives."
"20","POSITIVE","Nicely rewritten!"
"21","NEGATIVE","Where were all the journalists who recorded these bastards?
 Journalists after the Second World War and the fall of the Wall were asked why they did not openly report about it.
After all, this is the task of journalism.
The Third Reich and the GDR were dictatorships, and journalists had “no choice” to report about it.
If these circumstances are the same today, do we have a democracy today?
Or are many journalists in AfD Förderverein?
Because they just play through this “coverage” into the hands of those.
Thank you, Mr Aust, for at least mentioning things by name afterwards.
Through various social media, the mind-making population has informed themselves.
At that time, information condemned as fake news and mood-making, sometimes turn out to be true.
Or is this just the tip of the iceberg?
A small part of the big whole?!?!"
"22","NEUTRAL","trifle, but nevertheless: has the Afd not already competed in 2013 (at that time still under Lucke as a purely EU-critical party) and has just missed its entry into the Bundestag?"
"23","NEGATIVE","In any case, the five years so far have shown clearly and clearly that we are not able to do it - at least not the way we have done so far..."
"24","NEGATIVE","And even here, in a critical post: Pegida = extremists. Didn't you read Patzert's study? Unfortunately, with such indifference, the intended criticism remains superficial."
"25","POSITIVE","Dear Mr Aust, thank you for this equally great and disturbing summary of the events that will probably lead to the decline of our society as we knew it and would have liked to leave our children and grandchildren. Thank you Mr Aust!"
"26","NEUTRAL","This balance sheet and the related consequences, which are far from over, have prompted me to choose Australia as my permanent AE location - if I could do it..."
"27","POSITIVE","Good decision! We have the visas and our last flight from Germany goes away in 16 days to Down Under"
"28","POSITIVE","Great story! The best overview of the topic since the beginning of the refugee giant. And above all, I think, one thing becomes clear: how a political system and society can change within a few years through misinterpretations of a democratic-republican constitution and through the over-moralisation of politics (A. Merkel and the supposed green-red majority). Now the country is exposed to extreme political centrifugal forces.
In addition, with regard to a compelling EU-European solution to the migration problem, I believe Mrs Merkel has acted completely Prussian hegemonial in Germany alone and has put some pressure on other EU countries. In the course of this, it was left to the German public opinion makers to condemn all other EU countries as right-populist, heartless and violating the right of asylum. This is a bad situation!"
"29","NEUTRAL","In a large number of media, especially in public law, unilateral reporting on the subject of refugees took place. All critical statements about the current mass influx of so-called administrators or news editorial offices are prevented throughout the country. According to a recent survey by the Allenbach Institute for Demoscopy, only a very small proportion of the population is' balanced 'in the media; in some cases, the coverage is perceived as' one-sided '. Such a discrepancy between predominant messaging and subjectively experienced reality must make one thoughtful. It is quite true, writes the FAZ,... that in the refugee crisis some media have written and sent themselves around their heads and collars. All seriousness was demanded in the exuberance of the welcome culture not to report what is, but to proclaim for the good cause, that is, to make the facts beautiful, since reality cannot be expected to the stupid, unenlightened people.
 In German news broadcasts, the image of the immigrant refugee was often marked by the portrayal of touching individual destinies and the qualified skilled worker who could be integrated tomorrow if it was “not so bureaucratic”. On the other hand, much of the audience and readership concerned the question of the consequences of unlimited immigration of mostly unqualified young men, to a high percentage of illiterate young men? In particular, the public news stations often tried to missionize their viewers. The dictatorship of political correctness, often practiced by a multitude of different talk masters, has an irritating effect on me because it seemed no longer allowed to express one's own effort for a reasoned opinion, in short: the “yes, but”, the doubt about the usual black and white painting."
"30","NEGATIVE","And for some time now there has been a different tactic on this subject: we simply don't talk about it anymore and try to occupy the politically only superficially interested public by launching other issues."
"31","NEUTRAL","#Merz2021"
"32","POSITIVE","???? A board member of Black Rock is sure to make things better???"
"33","POSITIVE","Thank you."
"34","NEGATIVE","What does Mrs Merkel do, she is now kicking off the next migration of nations. Asia, too, must finally get rid of its overpopulation and certainly not the best will come."
"35","POSITIVE","Thank you for your moving summary, Mr Aust. The development of recent years is frightening and the fronts hardened from all sides. Her article gives hope because it does not cover up, cover up, but shows cause and effect."
"36","NEGATIVE","She (Mrs. Merkel) didn't get us through anything. She was always just a “placeholder” for a actually acting head of state. It has ridden the wave of economic success, but it has not brought about.
She managed and split like never before.
In foreign policy, it was the “rigidity” in a changed world. Without ever providing answers to the burning internal and external questions. This rigidity made them special from the gaze of others. It has done nothing in the long term.
It's a sad record. For Mrs Merkel, for Germany."
"37","NEGATIVE","I'm sorry. And you just don't want to learn from the mistakes. Or why does the AfD please have such an inflow? In principle, Mrs Merkel made this party big"
"38","NEUTRAL","I have often wondered what prompted the Chancellor, who, in fact, had a rather rigorous attitude towards immigration - let's say the CDU/CSU's' original 'attitude on this subject - to this paradigm shift. No matter how you turn it and turn it, I always get to mind this talk show in which a Palestinian girl, in my opinion, was quite sad that after years of uncertainty, she did not know whether she could stay in Germany; the girl seemed smart, spoke fluent German and seemed very well integrated and one wondered: when we talk about successful integration, we mean people like that, right? In the media, Merkel was torn for “her cold” at that time. Many of the Federal Chancellor's voices were made out of power calculations, specifically to win votes on the left of the middle. So far, this has worked out despite losses. Compulsory military service was lifted, nuclear power (which would now fit very well for a more balanced climate policy) was suspended, allowing same-sex marriage, a Eurorescue policy contrary to the Maastricht criteria and a few more trifles (e.g. kitapolitics, etc.). All not classically conservative positions. 
Then autumn 2015: I am of the opinion that Merkel has slipped away. Political blackout, perhaps under the impression of the talk show mentioned. And then an inability to admit mistakes, but rigidly hold on to the course. Maybe also a little Merkel's home (father was a pastor). Who knows... 
Considering how much it costs to deal with the migration crisis, how many people died by illegally entered terrorists (Brussels, Batanclan, Breitscheidplatz) and what difficulties (hopefully I will not be censored now) entails living together with different cultures... a little more unjumping CDU would have kept society together!"
"39","NEGATIVE","You put it in a nutshell. AM has massively geychadeed D with her power, arrogance and thickness.Too bad that she cannot be legal prosecution for this. In addition, she split D."
"40","NEUTRAL","Oh, Mr. Aust. You again. Are you finally applying for the AFD? YOU bore me. yawn,,,"
"41","POSITIVE","Klaus-Dieter: More respect please! Mr. Aust is the editor of the WORLD and he describes the truth and nothing but the truth! If that contradicts your way of perception, then you bring arguments. Everything else is mob and subclass!"
"42","NEUTRAL","@Reinhard B.: Comments on the editorial “Why AfD is not selectable” are probably actually suppressed."
"43","POSITIVE","Mr Aust, the documentation of Merkel's failed migration policy and the incredible failure of the state should be given in a printed summary. 
So we could tell our descendants what Germany once was a great country.
Economically strong, safety in the roads and a significant culture. The land of poets and
Thinkers. Our politicians took all of this from us. Not only Merkel, she certainly had
their faithful followers who did not dare Krtik. Their chancellor is now that of a totalitarian
State. If a politician ever dared to say cautious Kritk, he was put in the corner
in the same way. It is no longer about the good of the country and its citizens, it is about preserving
of power. The dead in the Mediterranean could have been prevented by closing the borders, the dead
and victims of Islamist terror and assaults as well. They invited the perpetrators. Capable politicians
would have foreseen the consequences, ours did not. By the left turn of Merkel, she naturally gets
the approval of all political groups except the AfD. The Greens demand open borders for all
and in the meantime even praise Mr Seehofer for his new policy. None of them look at the pictures in our cities, the feeling of insecurity. Our homeland and our lives have
changes dramatically and there is no end in sight. The elections in Thuringia have led to the frustration of the
Citizens shown. Meanwhile, Merkel is celebrating in India, taking responsibility for the fall of the
CDU now carries AKK. A skillful move by Merkel, like her entire policy. She will give us
leave the shards behind, I doubted that they were still to be putted. Only journalism such as the
Her gives me another hope. Thank you for that."
"44","POSITIVE","Thank you, Anne L."
"45","POSITIVE","Please be sure to watch the video of Helmut Schmidt bei Maischberger from 29.04.2015. What a smart head, in old age, with very clear views. Great politician and human being"
"46","POSITIVE","Yes - often think of the then phrases/H. Schmidt/above-mentioned programme/back/infinitely wise, sovereign, adequately distanced, informed and committed, visionary..."
"47","NEUTRAL","If, in addition to the conditions mentioned here, the foreseeable failure of the euro, and probably also of the entire EU, a also foreseeable collapse of the economy in Europe as a whole, and the necessary state intervention in private life and access to citizens' wealth, then grace us God."
"48","POSITIVE","Very good post, Rainer M. Thank you!"
"49","NEUTRAL","Merkel will go down in history, but negative.
As the refugee chancellor and the chancellor who stands for the decline of the CDU, for the division of German society and also the division of Europe, which is the cause of Brexit.
An end is not in sight until 2021, the media cover it, Germany quo vadis?"
"50","NEUTRAL","Dr. Merkel has taken us well through difficult times. Economically, Germany has never been so good in its entire history. In foreign policy, the Chancellor Germany has also established a position as the leadership of Europe... and and and...
There would have been few people who would have done this just as well, let alone better..."
"51","NEGATIVE","I have read and seen this documentary with great interest. Is there actually a book or DVD summary about it? Since these contributions are paid items, it is difficult to make them accessible to non-subscribers, which would be desirable and in many cases also necessary..."
"52","NEGATIVE","With a maximum recognition rate of 0.6%, they see the whole criminal drama that The Government is doing here. None of the 
98% deported persons subject to exit. 

Furthermore, the vast majority of refugees have no desire to integrate. Documents are thrown away, and this government makes you like all of this, at 2000,000,000 euros cost every month. Money that Germany doesn't have.




What are you writing about here?"
"53","POSITIVE","If you go through our country with your eyes open, then you don't need to talk about regular table slogans. 
I see you every day, those willing to work and integrate, who have long forgotten both!!"
"54","NEUTRAL","I am particularly concerned about the large number of people who come to us and then compete in our social system with the disadvantaged and needy people HERE for: housing, jobs, financial support, social support, school and childcare places. At the same time, Germany's industrial location is becoming unstable and therefore gross national product is eliminated, which we urgently need for this great social task. Can we do this?"
"55","NEGATIVE","No, no, no"
"56","NEUTRAL","All documentation should be compulsory “reading” in school history lessons."
"57","NEGATIVE","It will be, but unfortunately only in 30 years, when it says “how could this happen?” or ""I didn't know anything about it”"
"58","POSITIVE","Thank you, Mr Aust and Mr Büchel, for this important documentation! It's crazy, though, that it took four years to do this. I saved old media articles from 2015, 2016. How there was swallowed, for example in the focus, which talked about many opportunities over months, but then also about “challenges”. I do not see this catastrophic change in our former safe Germany as a fault of Merkel, even if it is politically rational (!) should have acted for the good of this country. But the mainstream in this country just wanted it that way. All the clever people were unable to refrain from the consequences and verbally threaten to the few attendees. Now you can handle it."
"59","NEGATIVE","Unfortunately, the attendants also have to deal with it..."
"60","NEGATIVE","Maximum exclusion of critically thinking, which show late consequences!!"
"61","NEUTRAL","Other episodes of 2015: maximum division of society across families, internet censorship against critics, Brexit due to images of the flood of migration, Trump President of the USA and a completely divided EU."
"62","NEGATIVE","On the other hand, if I look at the reasons behind Donald Trump's impeachment proceedings, they seem to me like a cavalier's offence against our Chancellor's long list of state failure. This woman and her voters have done irreparable harm to the country."
"63","NEUTRAL","That's right. Our Chancellor must not be afraid of a similar headwind. On the other hand, she is sure to expect a fine state act and a lifetime luxury pension...!"
"64","POSITIVE","Very good chronicle of events! If you look at the details, for example in the case of Amris Amri, you have to find out that the dead of Breitscheidplatz (remark on the edge: you have NEVER heard or seen personal names, stories or pictures of them, in other crimes there are already stories the next day) only for this reason were killed due to the policy of open borders."
"65","NEGATIVE","That's right! And it took almost two years and public protests from survivors and severely injured, to set up someone who should protect the interests of the victims at Breitscheidplatz! But if you could read how Brummi riders spontaneously gathered in Britain and then in other countries for the family of the colleague killed by Amri, this chancellor, who has indebted this and so much more, should be ashamed!"
"66","NEUTRAL","Migration is purely factually not about “we all love each other”, but about sharing the resources, infrastructure and values inherited from previous generations. 
For this reason, in the other Western immigration countries, there are clear criteria that regulate immigration according to their own needs. These criteria and effects should be discussed and decided by the public in a transparent and factual manner. The whole topic seems to me to be often transfigured in the discussion in Germany.
The temporary admission of recognised refugees is not meant by this."
"67","POSITIVE","Thank you Mr Aust 👍 for the clear analysis of the last four years so far. The observation of the present and the outlook for the future as a logical consequence of the upheavals in our society makes nothing positive to expect. It would be nice if her series also took this aspect into account. Thank you again for your excellent work."
"68","NEGATIVE","The story of the beginning of the decline of the Federal Republic of Germany. The legacy of a ruthless, irresponsible, stupid policy of a miscast as chancellor:
Angela Merkel's policy! The consequences for those who have always been here are a single disaster!"
"69","POSITIVE","Right!! Well recognized and also clearly written!"
"70","NEGATIVE","The German confused to be fucked with being loved. This is due to his laziness. If he admit he's being raped, he'd have to defend himself. But since he prefers to be “loved”, he bites his teeth together and rashes: “We can do this.” Future generations have a good laugh."
"71","POSITIVE","Thank you, that's exactly how it is 👌"
"72","NEUTRAL","I am very surprised that not yet a single comment has been printed in the editorial “Why the AfD is not selectable”.
My comment there, rather harmless, was the question of whether it was Western value and whether we Germans would still have to swallow it if the American ambassador Grenell recently said: ""... If we say you don't buy Russian gas, you buy American gas, that's how it's done...”"
"73","NEGATIVE","My harmless comment was also rejected. I had just referred to the counter-reason (immigration). The author Schuster did not allow a single comment. Why do you think so?"
"74","NEGATIVE","Would like to join me, but why does not a single comment on the editorial “Why the AFD is not selectable”?
WELT: That's just stupid! Holders you us for stupid?!!!?"
"75","NEUTRAL","Censorship. I'm sure you've come to mind yourself, haven't you?"
"76","POSITIVE","Ever since I saw and read this documentation, I've seen A.M. with different eyes. Your blame for mass immigration is much greater than I knew so far."
"77","POSITIVE","I'm glad you recognized that."
"78","POSITIVE","Many thanks to the WELT for letting me comment freely! 2015 my comments were deleted and I was blocked several times during the time."
"79","POSITIVE","At least now, a process of knowledge has started. Not at the ÖR or for example at the SZ, but at least here. And the fear of slander as a Nazi seems to have decreased somewhat."
"80","POSITIVE","I apologize in advance to criticize this grandiose contemporary history purely in terms of language. Still I stumble over a wording (also in the 21 videos)
“At least as long as there are people” MUST HOT “at least since there are people”
Our language is part of our identity, we should nurture and preserve it. Oh, thank you."
"81","NEUTRAL","Hmm? As long as it can be justified if the sentence thus introduced relates to the future. Whereas “since” refers to the beginning of a statement. I wouldn't put my demands on our language here as absolute as you do."
"82","POSITIVE","A thousand thanks to S. Aust and H. Büchel for this outstanding analysis of the impact of the “welcome culture” in Germany. They've made their way for our country. Please stay tuned to the subject. We need objective, independent journalism in these troubled times."
"83","NEGATIVE","Merkel has divided Germany and the whole of Europe. It's disgusting, and she's still being cheered. Very worrying."
"84","POSITIVE","As I read political newspaper articles, I read equally interested in the comments on it, each and every one. There is always a different picture that people are afraid to express their opinions openly, of the rise of especially young men from other cultures, a country that does not manage, of crime statistics, which disproves so much reported in the media, of the often pre-chewed media reports and You're beginning to feel like you're living in a dictatorship. The will of the population that
Sensation of security, even an AFD is completely ignored instead of dealing with the fears of the population. And we are all so powerless and powerless what actually happens. They talk nicely and nowhere simply tell the truth, because only then can you tackle the problem, perhaps it is not at all. The real huge problem is the endless legitimate periods of the Federal Chancellor in Germany, one should reduce it to 2, i.e. max 8 years and with great probability one could have reduced this article by half because much would not have happened any more. But it becomes persistent, we manage it, we manage it and Germany is rich, continued. A 2 party system would probably not be bad either, middle left, middle right, there is no more, we are a people of different opinions but neighbors and not enemies!"
"85","POSITIVE","You speak to me from the heart, love alice v."
"86","NEGATIVE","I don't see any other Germany. It is not really worth mentioning, of course some come with bad intentions; on the other hand, some German citizens also have bad intentions."
"87","NEUTRAL","Oh, and that's why the “people” with the “bad intentions” don't make the cheese fat anymore? Golden Views"
"88","NEGATIVE","“The state was overwhelmed at times, crimes and terrorism shook the citizens. Dramatic scenes took place at Europe's fences and camps.”

The state was overwhelmed? Crime and terrorism shocked the citizens? Dramatic scenes were played on Europe's fences and camps?

Everything already survived and therefore in the past form? Are you serious, Mr. Aust?"
"89","NEGATIVE","In just four years, we have got another Germany that will not change any more. This fact is visible and audible in any larger place. German is no longer spoken."
"90","NEUTRAL","at the latest in 20 years we have states here, as in the Middle East"
"91","NEGATIVE","Why do we keep being bothered with the A.A.'s face?"
"92","NEUTRAL","@ Volker
I mean the mass killer from Breitscheid Platz."
"93","POSITIVE","Thank you Mr Aust! Thank you Mr Büchel!
An impressive and oppressive report!
I would have liked you to have taken into account the problem of the Western Balkans as well. You remember: the first flood of asylum seekers in 2015 came from the Western Balkans, which were then declared to be safe countries of origin, coupled with the promise of simple legal labour migration (§ 26 para 2 BeBeBezV).
But I guess that would have gone beyond the scope."
"94","POSITIVE","Yes, four years - other Germany. Other me? My attitude to life has changed fundamentally. I used to discuss politics with friends for hours, I read Spiegel u Stern u Zeit, monitor, daily topics, political talk rounds, admired Bedford Strahm and Käsmann. I was a positive thinking, socially committed person. 
Now I am much more secluded, privatize, talk only politically to those who think similarly to me. I doubt my church, laughed at the political correctness duct at my university, I read here at WON and on the axis of good articles and comments to convince me that I am not alone with my opinion. I try to dismantling dystopias with beauty: holidays by the sea, nature. I'm avoiding downtown because I don't feel at home anymore in my city. I am still working for integration, understanding and cultural dialogues. Superficial, so as not to despair. But inside, I lost hope we could make it. I was also not asked if I was THE (what actually??) wants to create."
"95","POSITIVE","This describes exactly my location!!!"
"96","POSITIVE","A very good summary of what is happening. The consequences of this policy will continue to accompany us for many years and I fear that this policy will not succeed, but that policy will create us. Anyone who has mastered the basic arithmetic methods and walks through the German cities with open eyes can clearly calculate the consequences, especially since this policy continues unhindered to this day."
"97","NEUTRAL","Violation of human rights by national borders?
Are you still okay?"
"98","NEUTRAL","Left-green mindset..."
"99","NEGATIVE","As dramatic and unreversible as this is all. You can't wait for this to grow up. In recent years, it has been clear that mistakes have been made. But this is not being processed, but rather glorified, while not only the next wave of refugees is coming, but a review and exploding spending on EU membership. One should give tasks to those who supposedly know better, instead of using last forces to conduct an ideological small-scale war."
"100","NEUTRAL","please: recession"
"101","POSITIVE","Thank you very much, dear Mr. Aust, for this factual and pragmatic presentation of events since 2015.

Although I've been following everything very closely since then, although this compressed chronology is very shaken again and I'm very worried where this will all end..."

Her video series about migration was the reason for me to sign up for a world subscription. It was worth it. In part, it was difficult for me to see the summary of madness. But it was also interesting to look back at what has happened in the last four years, how Germany has gradually changed. To me, the behaviour of our politicians was and still is frightening."
"112","POSITIVE","Good summary.
But let us not imagine ourselves: if we had looked at our republic in the years 1948 to 1952, or 1968-1972, or 1988 to 1991, or or or our republic, these 4-year ranges would have been as eventful and changing as the years 2015 to today.
What am I trying to say? I do not want to relativate the migration problem. Rather, life is more eventful and changing in general. And when I think of the great wars and revolutions in our history, I would come up with much more eventful and more changing 4-year periods."

This is absolutely nonsense! No one has the right to just cross our border!

We just no longer have the strength and courage to prevent the transmission! You don't want “unsightly” pictures on TV! As soon as it speaks that crossing the border is no longer easily possible and there is no more all-round care, the whole thing would stop suddenly.

But we're too cowardly to do that!"

"120","NEGATIVE","I didn't choose this and I'm still affected..."
"121","POSITIVE","Thank you for the successful summary for me, Mr Aust. 

It becomes clear that Germany accepts, accepts and delegates responsibility to the bordering countries, but does not participate itself. 

On the inside, citizens must shoulder the financial and social costs of integration and migration. From two lost world wars and a gruesome German National Socialist history, however, it must not be deduced that Germany can and must be a place of departure for all and everyone now and for all time. 

Many people do not want that and ultimately the political camps are shifting to the edges and there is an unpeace in Germany that seems to have no end. Those responsible for this relude, withdraw or pretend the situation is critical, worth considering, etc. 

Now the task is to integrate more than one million predominantly male refugees without sufficient German and educational knowledge necessary for a modern industrial and service state. Deportations only work in very rare cases, and the legal situation seems to be insufficient. However, this is not amended by the Federal Government or the Federal Parliament. Keep calm; we manage this and acknowledging a difficult situation is all that has happened for years. 

The AFD is now felt for many the incoming party, which at least pretends a different opinion as well as a different direction towards all other parties. As long as the remaining parties come beyond recognition and seek only the lowest common denominator in a colorless way, people will continue to flow in one direction - where it is promised that their Germany will remain their Germany and not where it is said who will be with the current Germany as German is not satisfied, yes can go. Eventually, the dams break."
"122","POSITIVE","That was a wonderfully fitting comment. That's how I see it."
"123","POSITIVE","Thank you for your reports and summaries on the refugee crisis, Mr Aust.

That is important, I think, because everyone starts to develop their own view of things. With such an important part of German history, it can be difficult.

One more point I see differently: “Now they come as protection seekers, as war refugees, as asylum seekers”. Yes, and for various other reasons. For our society, however, these are side aspects. In principle, all people come first as equal new citizens, at the latest their children, who are growing up here. With many new and own ideas about the world and society. That's the big point we're talking about. Just talking about help and having in mind that in the end all people join the universal values - which happen to be our values - leads past the matter."

Why doesn't she feel that her time's run out.
History will expose her as Chancellor of arbitrariness, of escapement, of legal bending and incomprehensible refusal instead of trying to save the world or the climate or both

They write “The AfD will compete for the first time in the 2017 Bundestag election.” In 2013, the AfD was also there and received 4.7% of the votes. Perhaps a lot of things would have gone differently in the AfD if she had already made it."

Thank you very much to you and your fellow.

I would like to mention the article by Michael Stürmer, also in the WORLD:

“The stranger is only enriching in homeopathic doses!”

"148","NEGATIVE","Dear Mr. Aust, 
Dear Mr. Buechel, 

Her documentations are a milestone for outstanding journalism. In my opinion, reading this documentation in written word is another highlight. 

The documentation, as well as today's article, are heavy food. In retrospect, unfortunately, the concerns in my family and friends all turned into a sad truth. The events since 2015 divide and leave us citizens more and more perplexed. 

The articles on the so-called “Corridor of Opinion” published on WO confirm the perplexity and division. Citizens who grew up like me under Helmut Schmidt and Helmut Kohl, as well as in Bavaria under FJS, today miss the liberal-conservative centre. We ask ourselves: “Where has the sober contemplation of things remained?” And the state governments and the federal government ask themselves after each election day: “How could the AfD get so many votes?” Just incomprehensible. 

For 4 years now, some of them at WO have been and will be emotionalized. This discussion, burdened with enormous emotions, allows only black or white: “If you are not for me, you are automatically against me.” Dear Mr. Aust, Dear Mr. Buechel, your documentary as well as the written word puts the events on sober feet since 2015. It was urgent. 

My wish already expressed here in the Forum: your documentary on all the outside walls of the Chancellery in permanent loop and this, as well as many others of you, Mr Graw and Mr Döpfner, to the Members of the Bundestag, AM and AKK on their desk every morning.
For me the question arises: there is a federal press spokesman - ok, from the ÖR - and a press office. They should be able to compile the daily press review neutrally. How blind and deaf are our elected representative in the Berlin ivory bubble? 

THANK YOU THANK YOU KAR/1.11.19/ 14:35"
"149","NEGATIVE","I'm missing some info. The most important thing is that the refugees we let in 2015 were no longer in refugee camps near the Syrian border because the international community had failed to comply with the commitments to UNHCR. Payments from Germany, for example, were cut by 50% in 2014, despite the fact that the number of refugees had not decreased. The refugees in the camps were thus deprived of their livelihoods, and only 35% of the required benefits were available for livelihoods. The result was that a large number of war refugees left the border refugee camps towards Europe. Those refugees who hit the Hungarian and Austrian borders in 2015 came to Germany after the agreement of the German, Austrian and Hungarian governments. Hungary & Austria could not have made up for this. Without a doubt, it would have been better if the refugees could have stayed near their border in those camps. However, UNHCR is chronically underfunded. The rich states are much more likely to sell weapons than to provide for the victims of these weapons. If we were less greedy and stingy, these refugee crises could be prevented beforehand. In 2015, there should never have been, the UNHCR had warned in advance, it was in every newspaper. No one cared until those who survived the march to Europe suddenly came here."
"150","POSITIVE","@Michaela E. Unfortunately, it has been organized for several years so that every state can give as much or as little refugee aid as it wants. In 2015 I dealt in detail with the UNHCR and the 'United Nations' Refugee Agency. That's where I found it. Happy day - Best regards"
"151","POSITIVE","Dear Mr. Aust, Thank you for your excellent contribution. 

However, the sentence that there have always been migration triggers a reflexive contradiction in me. Earlier migration movements were not so large, often in the end, while the current movement seems to be a continuous one, precisely because of modern world population growth, the migrants were not entitled to higher social benefits and infrastructure, they were certainly not always as well organized as today's Migrant societies that vocally demand rights and complain about the majority society. 

But yes: “Together they are in search of a better life.” The open question is whether, with continued migration, all those present and descendants (!) , both migrated and non-migrated, can be guaranteed a good life by the economic and social system, especially when we include left-wing systems change dreams and, in my view, a dangerously growing control of opinions “to promote democracy.”

The migration of peoples to Europe in 2015 to this day has indeed changed Germany and the continent, in particular contributed to a drastic partisan political polarization of the population in the meantime, also strengthened extreme positions even in more bourgeois camps (for which I see the growing scepticism towards Immigration on the right, but also on the left, sometimes theatrical commitment to cosmopolitan openness and ultimately as few limits as possible). Are we able to do this, especially since, as our Foreign Minister also believes, saving people is not a crime? I'm afraid it's gonna be difficult. With ongoing migration, we cannot even stop, think soberly about what is going well in the immigration society called by whoever is, which entails great danger potentials, which must definitely be done differently. Everything will just go on. (?)"
"152","POSITIVE","Mr Aust describes in a pleasant and unexcited manner a series of events that have overtaken and changed Germany over the last four years. In the summary, these have an even more oppretative effect than the processes administered in homeopathic doses. 

Should an economic recession actually reach this country, I am looking forward to the distribution struggles. It is expected that a large part of our new guests will be able to contribute their experiences better than people who have previously been spared such experiences."
