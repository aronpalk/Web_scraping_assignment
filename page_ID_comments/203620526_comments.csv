"1","NEGATIVE","I am eagerly waiting for the ‚Äúdiscoveries‚Äù of this Pattex advertisers etc. to finally be a thing of the past."
"2","NEGATIVE","Now our chancellor soon managed to ruin this country. I didn't think she was afraid to be ridiculous with her statements üòÇ"
"3","NEUTRAL","Mrs. Merkel, the spouse of Fred Feuerstein, does not have the pale glow of digitalization, economy and progress. She managed to bring Germany far behind during her reign. Germany used to be innovative, and now we are decaying into the wasteland."
"4","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúData is the new oil‚Äù

‚ÄúSchnarchland‚Äù Germany is only a bit late. The ‚Äúoil sources‚Äù have long since secured others.

Amazon, Facebook, Google and Co. rub their eyes if such statements are unbelievably - if they have not fallen from the chair with laughter.

The banks who hoped to build ‚Äúgiropay‚Äù as a competition with PayPal had to recognize this. With moderate success, as can easily be seen by the sales figures.

Revenue Paypal: 15,500,000,000 USD (in words: 15.5 billion) 
Turnover giropay 00.000.470.000 EUR (in words: 470 thousand)"
"5","NEUTRAL","Addendum:
In Germany, 90% of online sales are used by Paypal.

The remaining 10% share giropay, paydirekt etc.

giropay started with the hope that potentially 45 million customers in Germany can ‚Äúuse‚Äù it - as can be seen by the sales figures, however, the reality states that hardly anyone changes the payment system if they have chosen one.

Why should someone who is registered with Paypal switch to another payment system?"
"6","NEGATIVE","When you hear what is spoken, you can only see that you leave the country if you want to have a future. So much clueless makes you mute! Can anyone tell Mrs. Merkel that sitting around in the chancellery is no longer worth..."
"7","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúDigitalization is going to change our society dramatically, it is already doing it today‚Äù she has been doing this since 1837, since Braille, Morse alphabet, telephone and radio technology, and e-mail. As a physicist, you don't have to know these facts, and as a Federal Chancellor, don't you?"
"8","NEGATIVE","I have my doubts about your qualities as a physicist. I was able to get a picture of science in the former Soviet Union at the time, in the GDR it will have been similar."
"9","POSITIVE","Not only on the subject: warning, criticizing, rejecting, worrying, rebellishing, blocking, demonstrating - that seems to be the commandment. Positive, innovative, courageous, at least friendlier and more peaceful. And this, unfortunately, not only in government and politics"
"10","NEGATIVE","You can only shake your head with the comments at this point: the nationwide expansion of the mobile network is probably a matter for the network operators - and not for the federal government! And how often does the construction of a mobile phone pole fail due to the exploitation of the right path by ‚Äúworried‚Äù local residents!"
"11","NEUTRAL","She picks up an old theme and wants to profile herself with the old outcast theme. How striking is that trying to stuff the holes as if she had come on it alone.
The state has collected 6.55 billion in the last auction of the 5G mobile radio licenses and now our BK is announcing to use 1 billion to close the radio holes. Where do we live??"
"12","NEGATIVE","Please help everyone change this government. It can hardly be worse. There are also orange vests."
"13","POSITIVE","@J√∂rg S., If someone organizes the change possibilities, I'm happy to help with the ""Modify‚Äù. I'd have a yellow vest. But the organizer must also be a lawyer, eloquent; also a leader, etc. It must happen nationwide, simultaneously and star-shaped, towards Berlin. ""Who knows?"
"14","NEUTRAL","The government has correctly recognized that after the next Bundestag election many of its current MPs will disappear in the sink, because a new authority is the right catcher. With the supervisory board and advisory board, as has proven itself at Berlin-Brandenburg Airport. The radio hole completely replaces the government."
"15","POSITIVE","A stunned man/woman can only shake his head over this knowledge. Would be glad of an early choice!"
"16","NEGATIVE","This woman just makes me angry. As the most powerful woman in the world, as the savior of Europe and as the economic guarantor of a thriving Germany."
"17","NEUTRAL","Hurray, again a new society in which posts can be awarded to ‚Äúqualified‚Äù party members again. At the Bauakademie in Berlin it worked wonderfully.
Why couldn't it be integrated into existing structures? Then there would be no need for a new Supervisory Board, Executive Board or Advisory Board. A separate department would have been sufficient.
How much of the one billion euros flows into the ‚Äúwater head‚Äù and how much is actually spent on the expansion?"
"18","NEGATIVE","You can't get my data.
Funny also the discussion about Huawei. 
Has anyone read the article about Amazon in the World on Sunday?
Mrs Merkel apparently yes, just with the other angle of view, that of Bezos."
"19","NEUTRAL","In 2013, the Internet was still new ground.
The complete quote:
 ‚ÄúThe Internet is new territory for all of us, and it naturally also allows enemies and opponents of our democratic basic order to endanger our way of life with completely new possibilities and completely new approaches.‚Äù
Six years later, Merkel is one of the leading (self-proclaimed) experts in digitalization."
"20","NEGATIVE","The worrying thing about her statements is that Merkel often makes hints in subparagraphs that cost the taxpayer a lot of money. 

The only clear thing about their statements is that nothing is clear."
"21","NEUTRAL","I would have handed over the task of network expansion to the Federal Network Agency. BNetzA regulates only the telecommunications market, but could also take care of the further expansion of the network with additional staff. That would be much cheaper than starting a supply post subsidiary. You can imagine how much of this money will arrive on the mobile network..."
"22","NEGATIVE","‚ÄúAccording to the strategy, the company is to be established as a subsidiary of the state truck toll operator Toll Collect with its own supervisory board. It will be supported by an advisory board composed of representatives from the federal government, the state and local authorities. ‚Äú

And the last one is the deadly sentence!
So all hot air, alone due to the composition of the on-‚Äú council‚Äù nothing will happen..."
"23","NEGATIVE","‚ÄúIn addition, the state can spend a lot of money, including on investment. ‚Äú

Also for investments? 
Yes, there is money in excess, since one persistently refuses to give the taxpayers something back or to reduce the tax burden. At least one would spend it meaningfully. For example, for investments, infrastructure, digitization, AI, education, research, etc. Instead, a huge amount of money is sunk into the social, with an ever-increasing tendency to buy voters. But this will not benefit our country, it will break."
"24","NEGATIVE","Others discovered the ‚Äúnew oil‚Äù 30 years ago. But at least better late than never. Now please have a late look in other areas."
"25","POSITIVE","Don't let them get irritated.
Everything that woman gives of herself could have been done years ago.
She just tries to collect pluses."
"26","POSITIVE","As always, when you enter new territory, you should take special care. But we can do it!"
"27","NEGATIVE","‚ÄúMerkel said that data is the ‚Äúnew oil‚Äù today. Data is a raw material from which new business products should be created.‚Äù

Hm, is this ‚Äúnew oil‚Äù the stuff Google has earned for many years stupid and stupid? Then it could be compared to the Internet, which appeared on the agenda relatively recently. I think we were talking about ‚Äúnew land‚Äù (2013). 

To stay in technology, there are upgrades and updates. How about that? 
If you're late, a relaunch would be possible. 
Only you shouldn't tie the other on your neck like that, if you don't know."
"28","NEUTRAL","When yesteryear's eternally fabulate about new technologies, you can only fear and fear."
"29","NEUTRAL","If I didn't miss it, this billion is ultimately a gift to the mobile operators. And who runs and maintains these radio towers?
And this new company is to be installed ‚Äúas a subsidiary of the state truck toll operator Toll Collect‚Äù. This will be a permanent setup, guaranteed. New posts for halted politicians?"
"30","POSITIVE","@Thomas R, exactly, you can do both. 
The benefit should be clear to everyone.
All with a 24 months 4GB toggle contract, can consume their data volume in under 2 seconds with 5G."
"31","NEUTRAL","What has so far been hardly mentioned in the discussion are also issues of nature protection, especially landscape protection. 

The 5G standard requires a large number of rather small-scale radio cells and thus systems. And this is also quite widespread ‚Äúoutside‚Äù in the landscape, if the most complete coverage of even the smallest interurban roads (keyword autonomous driving) is to be established. This will also affect many protected areas, for example. 

We can look forward to the upcoming discussions."
"32","NEGATIVE","5G is not intended for use in the area either."
"33","POSITIVE","By digitization, Mrs. Chancellor clearly understands that you can watch funny cat videos on your mobile phone anywhere in Germany."
"34","NEUTRAL","Yeah, and?
That's what the local politicians do here in the city.
So stringent action from A to Z!"
"35","NEGATIVE","The mobile operators should have expressed solidarity and boycott the auction together. Instead of the necessary expansion, for which there is no longer enough money left, the money went into the barrel without the bottom of the Merkel waste of money."
"36","NEUTRAL","Can it be that you drive so 5G forward with the reason to close the spark holes in order to keep the resistance small"
"37","NEUTRAL","We should rather invest in education and our manufacturing industry, because only services and digitalization can no one live in the long run."
"38","POSITIVE","I can recommend the book 21 lessons for the 21st century by Yuval Nosh Harari - why you are right, but in the long term wrong with your statement for Germany"
"39","MIXED","I think rather the oil that she has discovered comes from her oil leak, because really lubricated run on the already long no gears anymore."
"40","NEUTRAL","I would be interested in how you can use data to operate a heating system. New oil probably only when it comes to making money."
"41","NEGATIVE","Most probably will no longer experience the great digitalization and network expansion.

Am now 41"
"42","NEUTRAL","It is logical that, after the destruction of the landscape by thousands of giant wind turbine masts, the acceptance of such structures as mobile masts has suffered considerably. 
There are other technical solutions than just radio poles.
Germany has often only invested half-heartedly in the right innovations for 20 years.
Does this have anything to do with the SPD's government participation?"
"43","NEUTRAL","The state wants a ‚Äúmobile infrastructure society‚Äù. How much has the word designer and historical consultant taken from the billion?
If the state already founded such societies, I would once again tap a billion burial."
"44","NEGATIVE","Why is the only way to talk about mobile communications? What about the gaps in broadband expansion?
A look at the broadband atlas is enough to see that there are massive problems."
"45","NEUTRAL","If you maintain this speed in digitization in D, in a few years more Chinese tourists will come to experience such a backward country once in natura. The Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Defence employ many advisers, how about Mrs B√§hr taking care of advisers?"
"46","NEGATIVE","It's very bad, first auctioning the frequencies expensively and withdrawing the money from the providers to expand - and then complain about improper expansion and funding with billions of taxpayers' money. After the promotion, leave this infrastructure to the providers. The loser is, as always, the taxpayer."
"47","NEGATIVE","@Knutsch K.
I would have liked to explain that.
The state puts a fraction of the money received for the licenses in radio towers and then, according to its theory, abandons them to the providers.
And as a result the taxpayer loses????

Or do they just have no idea what they're writing?"
"48","NEUTRAL","Clearly Middle Ages - digital Middle Ages! As an ex-employee of a well-known electronics market and chip manufacturer, I know that you can not only scare away ‚Äúpre-tortious‚Äù hard & software to the unsuspecting German population, but also Merkel's ‚ÄúNeuland Internet‚Äù is taking revenge so slowly! The distance between mainly Asian companies, including the enthusiasm and IT knowledge of large parts of the population especially from Germany, is now insufficiently described even with the words ‚Äúgigantic‚Äù or ‚ÄúIT-Middle Ages‚Äù - and can NOT be caught up with this speed of development. But the receipt for us (our youth) is still coming - in all areas!"
"49","POSITIVE","Hi Robinson Jr. there I have to agree, but an outdated Internet is also much easier to control, even in schools the education ‚Äúsings‚Äù never where."
"50","NEGATIVE","I can't believe that this government actually has the idea to move on to some of the latest technologies. Okay, because you didn't insist on full coverage at the auction, not back then and not today. But now out of taxpayers' money to cover the failure?

And yes, the speed at which such decisions are implemented clearly shows that Merkel will no longer experience this, perhaps Altmaier. 

Can't you rather build a wind turbine in which transmitter poles are integrated?"
"51","NEUTRAL","Meanwhile, Asians have wireless power transmission in practice! Transmission masts & wind turbines in one are definitely required in Germany an extra special - super special permit, taxation, safety check for which neither T√úV, Grundgesetz or public authorities are designed at the moment."
"52","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúEnergiewende‚Äù, BER, infrastructure, the railways, pension financing, refugee crisis, healthcare system, digitalization... what problem has it actually solved?"
"53","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúThe government wants to set up a mobile infrastructure company to support the expansion and, if necessary, to award contracts themselves.‚Äù

Until this new paper tiger stands, the first aircraft may start at the BER."
"54","NEUTRAL","Mrs Merkel is about 10 years late on the subject of data. During network expansion more than 15 years. Digitization... Was there an article in the Apothekenrundschau or how does it come up with it now?"
"55","POSITIVE","Merkel reads in the pharmacy bummi...
that hits it, rarely so laughed.
Thank you."
"56","NEGATIVE","For me still unclear whether the patchwork is due to the economical vendors or the permits. The report is there and not at all clear at all in other places, it just takes a short break and does not provide clear information. Then, for example, there are spots in connection with data security below - where is this connection? 
Not a great post, unfortunately."
"57","NEUTRAL","I firmly believe that digitalization (in addition to globalization) is the most asocial development we are experiencing. The consequences for the labour market and society cannot be imagined... and the dependence on digital periphery also worries me: what about in the event of a big blackout with all the computer-controlled fierce??? Keywords: drinking water, traffic regulations, cashless payments etc.?? I think a somewhat more analogous existence would be more than beneficial to all involved"
"58","NEUTRAL","Stuttgart: One of the most economically viable regions in Europe. On the A8 around the cross there are still serious spark holes today. According to studies, we occupy 50 places worldwide on the mobile Internet. This government's claim is ridiculous. Giving over 100 billion for economic migrants and just one billion left for the digital future? The CDU is simply no longer available for conservative citizens."
"59","NEUTRAL","Great that Mrs. Merkel has noticed that there are radio holes in Germany. Much more worrying than this realization at a snail pace, I find that data provided to the state by the citizen is passed on to third parties without asking the citizen. That's in line with Mr Spahn's plans. To me, it looks like the plan is full control, well the woman has finally grown up in a surveillance state."
"60","NEUTRAL","What part of us has she not sold to any company yet?"
"61","NEGATIVE","Sorry,

Could not read the report at the end. I laughed tears... coming business partners I have to fix the makeup!"
"62","NEGATIVE","... The new oil.????
The topic has been known for years and is being docked by our policy. Does Berlin think that the German voters don't know???"
"63","NEGATIVE","If he didn't, she wouldn't still be in the chancellery."
"64","NEGATIVE","So my opinion is.. Mrs. Merkel is no longer part of Germany!!
Let her look for a new country in which she places flourishing landscapes and a good running society in ruins..!!"
"65","NEUTRAL","Merkel's statement: we create the"
"66","NEUTRAL","After all, with a little delay, the Chancellor has discovered the data."
"67","NEUTRAL","The grand coalition was re-elected several times. 
Keep it up, Germany.
(to use an ollen CDU claim)"
"68","NEUTRAL","But only those who have not chosen CDU/CSU, SPD, Left or Green may complain."
"69","NEUTRAL","The top trends in the German Twitterreich are currently

#GoodbyeDeutschland 
and
#bauersuchtfrau

Yeah, yeah."
"70","NEGATIVE","Once again, the citizens are beeping, again it will only be a matter of lobbying for large corporations."
"71","NEUTRAL","It's been like this for years and is elected again and again."
"72","NEUTRAL","As long as Germany's small area is not covered with a narrow broadband and seamless mobile network, the German government should not put the word ‚Äúdigital strategy‚Äù in its mouth. Education, internal security, border protection, asylum policy, controlled immigration, high taxation, rental prices, dilapidated infrastructure, underground rail transport, digitalisation - we are among the people today."
"73","NEGATIVE","Unfortunately, this only shows how lame the federal government is. Our CEO called ‚ÄúThe new oil‚Äù as Core Belief more than 2 years ago and first digitization strategies have already been implemented... and Fr. Merkel is only now aware that we have spark-holes that I have been driving through every day for 13 years and can't work professionally and effectively, my foreign colleagues just giggle..."
"74","NEGATIVE","In the meantime, this ripping government is so brazen that it is loosely clucked us.Billions for frequencies which, strictly speaking, belong to amateur radio operators since the 20s and now ‚Äúgenerously give 10 or 20% of the last blackmail to the citizens. have. Certainly because of the high frequency fees and therefore this is strictly part of our taxes and duties."
"75","NEGATIVE","And again the woman talks about something she has no idea about. Recently she's ‚Äúnew ground‚Äù for her and now she believes that data is the new oil. I'm iTler, now I'm even more scared."
"76","NEGATIVE","Data is the oil, not the line."
"77","NEUTRAL","The ‚Äúnew oil‚Äù is new ground for all of us. As with the Internet Mrs. Merkel at least 10 years and many bad laws too late."
"78","POSITIVE","For this realization the grande dame of the Driven took 15 years. Bravo. And now a government agency is being installed, bravo. And she laments the planning period after fifteen years of government, bravo. 
The CO2 tax legislation was chased through parliament on a Friday (marriage for all, nuclear phase-out too). You just have to set priorities."
"79","NEGATIVE","I'm on the train from Hamburg to Bremen, from Hamburg to Frankfurt, actually no matter where. Always no reception. No matter where and wherever, Germany is the testimony of technical development. And now, years later, Mrs. Merkel realizes that there are certain holes. She could've asked me 10 years ago. I could have named her 100th of sites. No progress ever since. This is either stupidity or absolute denial of reality."
"80","POSITIVE","Why do I need a connection on the train, on a subway/suburban train - for 30 minutes? I sit relaxed, prepare myself undisturbed on my appointment or enjoy the ride and chill. It's worth more than the rush of everyday life. Stress-free and relaxed arrive is better than hectic activity. Anyone who needs to be online 24 hours a day deserves my pity!"
"81","POSITIVE","I am more and more surprised by the IT developing country Germany. Instead of discussing it is important to implement - all these things have been heard from different parties for years, mostly before the election. As long as I have better and faster Internet in Africa than in Germany (no joke, experienced professionally again) I think we should better create a post ‚ÄúIT Development Minister (m/f/d)‚Äù which uses our development aid in my own country."
"82","NEUTRAL","Taggesschau (tagesschau 20 years ago) - 02.07.1999 from 11.Minute:
Siemens - Mobile phone applications from China - Build mobile network for up to 2.5 million subscribers...

These times are long gone."
"83","NEUTRAL","Oh, hmm.
May I remind you of physics?
Radiation, whatever kind, ends in heat.
I thought we had ‚Äúclimate‚Äù, but that doesn't matter again..."
"84","NEGATIVE","This flows into these calculations as little as the solar cycles or other unimportant things that cannot be taxed."
"85","NEUTRAL","So Merkel wants internet at every milk jug? The only question is whether the cows agree with its speed at all, let alone the farmers, for example! üòÇ"
"86","NEGATIVE","For me, Mrs Merkel is the queen of the wrong decisions. 
Data should be the new oil, if the BK says that, I will 
suspicious."
"87","NEGATIVE","Has someone already calculated how expensive this new oil bill 
and from whom we need to obtain this data oil."
"88","NEGATIVE","When does the last German realise that this federal government with its members - i.e. ministers are completely screwing us.
For many areas, money is treated like cologne camels and thrown out with all hands. Other foundations that are decisive for the future will be dealt with shy and even worse.
Where are the German yellow vests?"
"89","NEUTRAL","Yes, Werner, I've been wondering that for a long time."
"90","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúDigitalization will dramatically change our society, it is already doing so today,‚Äù Merkel said in Meseberg. - It's just embarrassing when our leading federal politicians deal with digitalization. It gets even worse if you, our Federal Chancellor Mrs Merkel away from the front, make a public statement. LTE, the network at this meeting, was launched as the 4th generation of networks in May 2010. In Sweden and Norway already at the end of 2009 (again a nice example as others were ahead of us). And now, almost 10 years later, politics are taking care of a comprehensive supply of this network. How caring. I'm really fond of that. But Mrs Merkel also surprised us today with other realization:
‚ÄúMerkel said that data is the ‚Äúnew oil‚Äù today. Data is a raw material from which new business products should be created.‚Äù I think now you're out of the house at Goggle, Facebook, Amazon etc. Hardly anyone would have expected that.
And I'm sitting here wondering what we deserve such a government that seems to be living behind the moon in some things. Just under 2 years and then the world wide web celebrates its 30th birthday. And LTE in Germany in 6 months his tenth. But we will probably not have a comprehensive supply yet. You could laugh at it if it were not so sad and embarrassing and unfortunately also a reflection of many areas in Germany where politics simply did not recognize the signs of the times, new demands and orientations."
"91","NEUTRAL","Man, we're modern now. üòÇ"
"92","NEUTRAL","Did ma ever check Mrs. Merkel's doctoral thesis? It's pretty late on what supports our prosperity."
"93","NEGATIVE","Did she really ever write that? I have serious doubts about the whole past that we are being develled about this woman."
"94","POSITIVE","Finally surf anywhere with EDGE or GPRS, even in the deepest forest. I'm thrilled."
"95","NEGATIVE","Peakoil has long been reached. The business models are already developed in the USA and are already using our movement and consumption data. Now the US has the health data on the screen and we can't and don't even want to fight back! 
Germany spends millions of dollars on a sickness card and it doesn't even work. Well, China and the USA are drilling for new oil fields on the high seas and we try the hoe in the front garden swung by Digitalomas. 
Data are like oil that glide easily out of your hand. Or are intercted by AM's personal mobile phone. But what the hell, let's go!"
"96","NEGATIVE","It can't be tolerated anymore. Our politicians really want to educate us as a European. Then why do we not orient ourselves to our neighbouring countries, where much works better than we do? Digitalization, medical care, care, school education to name but a few. With our being, the world will not recover. Just look outside the box and see what the others do. I think that would bring us further, and it would not hurt our reputation in Europe."
"97","POSITIVE","@ Anna T.
I fully agree with you! Perhaps we are on the way to political decadence."
"98","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúMerkel said that data is the ‚Äúnew oil‚Äù today. Data is a raw material from which new business products should be created.‚Äù

Na there our government with NetzDG and GDPR has ensured that the oil bubbles with us abundantly."
"99","POSITIVE","As long as you even need a consent for a simple WhatsApp group, it bubbles sparingly."
"100","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúHow to reassure the citizens or even delight them, does the chancellor still have to learn. ‚ÄúAs with the pioneers... Where does the Basic Law say that ‚Äúcitizens‚Äù need to be calmed and excited? How infantile is that?"
"101","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúMerkel said that data today is the ‚Äúnew oil‚Äù Too late, the market has long been divided, We never had oil either. So, rather keep the old economy alive than mutating into an agrarian state with wind turbines."
"102","NEGATIVE","Close the last of the radio holes... I'm laughing at myself. Nowhere where where I was abroad, the network was as bad as in D. Albania is supposed to be better..."
"103","NEUTRAL","‚ÄúMerkel said that data is the ‚Äúnew oil‚Äù today. Data is a raw material from which new business products should be created.‚Äù

Yeah, I think so. Pick up and sniff everything that drives and does citizens."
"104","NEGATIVE","Yes, as in the GDR, only more modern, if it works with the announcements and implementation. 
Still Merkel and GroKo only talk about it, in the end it will be just hot air again or it will be more expensive than thought or it will never finish or..."
"105","NEUTRAL","The number of neighbours, who therefore no longer speak to each other, is likely to be in the thousands.
That woman has experience in it."
"106","NEGATIVE","Why does my stomach feel so dizzy when I hear that this woman has now discovered digitalization for herself? If you make comparisons to the energy transition, it is to be expected that smoke signs or pigeons will soon be used to send messages again!"
"107","NEUTRAL","A ‚Äúmobile infrastructure society‚Äù?
Is there a fallen politician who needs a well-endowed job?"
"108","NEUTRAL","It always exists."
"109","POSITIVE","Easy solution.
Either a radio pole or a wind turbine. Alternatively, a radio mast on the wind turbine"
"110","NEUTRAL","But neither of them next to the villa quarter and where otherwise the Besservolk robs and grills."
"111","NEGATIVE","They're not politicians, they're ignorant laymen. This country is an experimental lab with us as a test rabbit. With bitter output."
"112","NEGATIVE","But the GroKo is in the radio hole! Almost all countries oblige the providers to cover, Here you sell for billions of air - you can safely introduce a radio hole tax with Task Force Mr. Scholz!"
"113","NEUTRAL","All auctions before 5G were not subject to conditions. 
With 5G, mobile companies must, compulsory, expand the network covering all disciplines."
"114","NEGATIVE","This government is, sorry, too stupid for the simplest things. 
1. ‚ÄúWe turned the screw on and imposed tougher obligations than in the past.‚Äù No, she didn't. The Green Harbeck rightly puts his finger in the wound, namely that not a high percentage of households need to be supplied, but of the area. 
2. UMTS 5 was just shot into the landscape out of new greed before UMTS 4 was implemented nationwide. U5 may be promising, with U4 everywhere the vast majority of existing applications would probably be sufficiently supplied. 
But no, that has to come up with something new quickly to cover the old mistakes; and you do the next one. Business as usual."
"115","NEGATIVE","And since we have so much data that is generated by mobile, our government should join Gigabit Internet in the same way as a landline. - Would possibly spare some ‚Äúdouble digging‚Äù for cables.

At the moment, the bandbeeite may be enough, but if we do not want to lag behind constantly, we just have to take money in our hands and borrow some EURO from the ECB. - Not so much food. - And yes, Germany could afford it.

We got in the district first 50 Mbit, now get, the last farms even ne own fiberglass line, because the still with 1-10 Mbit ‚Äúrumkrebsen‚Äù...
The path goes in the right direction. - But I miss it already that where just for a water pipe is dug up, it is also taken care of NEN telecom cable (fiberglass), or at least an empty pipe... 

We should not admit that in 2030 or later 100 Mbit is considered ‚Äúa lot of bandwidth‚Äù... - More and more devices will want to communicate with each other faster and faster. - 

Currently I have 100 Mbit, it's okay, but I don't think that in 10-15 years this will still be ‚Äúmuch‚Äù."
"116","NEGATIVE","Two years ago, in the summer, I was on a short trip on the Baltic Sea for three days. At the time I had a mobile phone provider in the e-network - that was bad: You are already used to not having a mobile Internet in Germany, BUT: I had absolutely NO mobile reception there! Even calling an emergency number would not have been possible! This is really embarrassing for a so-called highly developed industrial country..."
"117","POSITIVE","So that you survived this... all respect."
"118","NEGATIVE","Yes... when does the content come? This is phrase-threshing like a SED party convention. The role of meaning..."
"119","NEGATIVE","This government is the gravedigger of the liberal order - the data of which the Chancellor so generously squabronized do not belong to her or the state - they belong to the individual citizen alone. What has been announced is the creeping process towards the glass citizen. It's unbelievable."
"120","NEUTRAL","Yes, vegetables, that's right. The world begins to discuss giving the data back to the citizen. And AM wants to start collecting them now and then better provide the citizens with advertising. It has never become MORE! Just an increase in consumption."
"121","NEGATIVE","‚ÄúMerkel said data is the ‚Äúnew oil‚Äù today.‚Äù
A sentence that goes down like oil. 
One might think that very good lobbying is showing its effect here. After all, is this not the responsibility of the providers? And with the prices we pay here in contrast to other countries, I feel like a milking cow anyway."
"122","NEGATIVE","Close the last holes? I'd rather say connect the few reception islands together..."
"123","NEUTRAL","If we had done this earlier, there might not be the white spots today. In addition, the state can ‚Äúspend a lot of money,

"124","NEUTRAL","If Mrs Merkel ‚Äúdiscovers‚Äù something, it will be expensive for the taxpayer/pricing citizen."
"125","NEUTRAL","Health concerns... the cities of Brussels and Geneva have also raised about this in the expansion of the 5G antennas. Both cities have stopped or banned the expansion and called for independent studies on health risks. The cities further explain: ‚Äúthe exposure of electromagnetic fields is already high and would thus be further increased - with unpredictable consequences for human health and the environment‚Äù.
Today we complain about the industrialisation of the oil and the resulting CO2 share in the environment. 
Today, under the term climate protection, all people who do not follow the trend of new acquisitions are called to pay. 
With regard to the consequences of mobile networks, we will then see the impact in 20 years. Who will probably be asked to checkout again? With what damages that are then apparent? 
And why exactly does the current mobile systems not suffice for today's mobile users? or who exactly want/needs/demands 5G? 
After 5G there is certainly the next technical revolution?!"
"126","POSITIVE","We need 5G so that we can get even more digital services that we can pay even more expensive. For example, in the future, you can have your children brought to kindergarten with an autonomous transport capsule. Isn't that great now? Or the pizza comes with the drone flown in front of the window, cold but incredibly modern. We need 5G for a dream future."
"127","NEGATIVE","Another very classic wrong decision. It is not the task of taxpayers to solve levies of mobile operators. By means of legislative measures, the legislature should have induced the operators to carry out the coverage in such a way that a spark hole could be created."
"128","NEUTRAL","Perhaps now part of the miliar proceeds from the auction of frequencies will be used for specific purposes.

A.F."
"129","NEUTRAL","It is not up to the state to pay for the digital infrastructure when commercial companies make money using it.
It is the responsibility of the state when granting mobile communications licences to oblige the providers to fulfill the comprehensive coverage."
"130","NEGATIVE","First of all, I fully agree with your last sentence. But the error lies in licensing. In fact, the mobile operators are given a huge amount of money that the operators lack for the expansion of the necessary infrastructure. Other states were not so short-sighted and stupid in the allocation of these frequencies and did not cut off the operator so horrible sums. On the contrary. They have committed mobile operators to invest this money in the expansion of their infrastructure. And while the German federal government is still discussing LTE, the other states already have almost 100% coverage with 5G."
"131","NEGATIVE","Which company or authority connects their computers and data processing to radio?
That's totally wrong, politely said."
"132","POSITIVE","Best still on 27,000 MHz then no one will notice it! :):)."
"133","NEGATIVE","Mrs Merkel and the ladies and gentlemen colleagues have unfortunately already done a lot, done???"
