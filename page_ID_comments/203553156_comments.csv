"1","NEGATIVE","The elites need the Greens to safeguard their interests, after the SPD can no longer guarantee a majority of government. This is the only way to explain propaganda for the Greens in all media. This propaganda will in all likelihood succeed."
"2","POSITIVE","Thoughtful sounds are good.
There is currently an early cold wave in the US. Winter chaos in the south of France and snowfall in Mallorca. Probably the NASA forecast is right, and we're heading towards an ice age. In order to slow down climate change, the motto will soon be: We have to turn completely over and release more CO2 into the atmosphere."
"3","NEGATIVE","Mr. Habeck their era is also coming to an end. With her statement: I can't do anything with Germany. I wonder what are they still doing in Germany."
"4","NEUTRAL","“How can they change the world when they cannot change their socks?” (Margaret Thatcher)

“When Robert Habeck takes off his shoes at the ICE onboard bistro, which he doesn't always, but actually likes to do, because he's probably more at home on trains than anywhere else, it can already happen and you can see the holes in his socks. He's not embarrassed about it. He looks at you like holes in his socks are the most normal in the world. They probably are, too. Only his associate looks first at his boss, then the holes on his feet under the table and finally at me, the journalist. His gaze is trying to forbid me from seeing all this. And of course I didn't see anything.” (Jana Hensel, “The Time”)

All about the topic..."
"5","NEGATIVE","Your opinion and polemic could have been saved. I wouldn't write about you either if you behave wrong. There is no longer a dispute about political issues, which is important in socio-political terms about our future, but only to make every downside."
"6","NEUTRAL","The bourgeois parties have never been as weak politically as they were at that time. So it would be time for the Greens to venture far into the political centre. It could, for example, make itself a prominent party for genuine democracy. This makes sense when talk shows call for “the regulation of freedom of expression” ircontradictory, or when AFD politicians (in general) “humanity” are denied. To my knowledge, Article 1 of the Basic Law also applies to terrorists who have committed a mass murder, and that is right! Both Merkel and AKK, Merz and Scholz are not really opponents for Habeck. Robert Habeck could win people's hearts. He could even reach conservative voters. If his party leaves him, Habeck could make the Greens the only people's party in Germany. So if it doesn't work now, when? In the mid-twenties (with a view to the 2026 election), the Union traumatized by Merkel will either have recovered or the AfD will have become the People's Party."
"7","NEUTRAL","“He could even reach conservative voters.” Probably not, as an important overall social issue is unfortunately lacking."
"8","NEGATIVE","What does Mr Habeck mean when he says “we become constitutionalists”?
These are completely new sounds. Or do I see that? 
He means something like unofficial employees (IM or just snitching). 
The left wanted to ban the protection of the constitutional. Probably for good reason."
"9","POSITIVE","Not right to housing but right to apartment, Mr. Habeck!!!
Just like in Austria, so that speculators can finally be turned the “Rooster”.
In Germany apartment is a commodity!?
You can also live in a cardboard box under the bridge..."
"10","NEGATIVE","CO2 emissions are clearly too low for living in cardboard boxes, especially in winter. That's why there's shelter for the homeless."
"11","NEGATIVE","“The market does not regulate itself, but concentrates prosperity gains increasingly on a few and generates increasing costs to the detriment of the weakest.” And, as it may seem, the “stupidest”... i.e. the wage taxpayers and the loyal taxpayers from the upper middle class - all who do not do CumeX business, financial crises and tax volatile can be his."
"12","NEUTRAL","I am definitely not a Greens voter, but I am well counting on the public address regarding greater tolerance of the opposite side.
Let's see what is made of it at the base"
"13","NEUTRAL","The Habeck hurts the heart for the peasants? The peasants existed thousands of years ago, and they will continue to exist in the distant future, and his tenderness is therefore ridiculous."
"14","NEGATIVE","After Habek wants to abolish democracy, I am surprised that this party is not being watched by the VS."
"15","NEUTRAL","The Union is thinking about rules in the area of freedom of expression, wants to relax postal and postal secrecy, has been dismantling the powers of the judiciary for years, see PolG in Bavaria etc. 
And these aren't just ideas you have as an opposition, you're in power... but what you choose you get."
"16","NEUTRAL","Minimum fee for self-employed workers? How's he gonna do it? We work globally! How about tax cuts and more credibility of operating costs, less bureaucracy, for example?"
"17","NEGATIVE","I simply do not accept this hypocritical appeal for more tolerance towards those who think differently. This simply contradicts their self-righteous claim to know what is good for the “ignorant rest” of the population."
"18","NEUTRAL","The most important policy area for many citizens is domestic policy, with a focus on migration and security policy. Didn't Habeck say anything about that?"
"19","NEGATIVE","Even if the Green Party should pay 20% in the next Bundestag election, I am glad that 80% did not vote them..."
"20","NEUTRAL","Perhaps Mr Habeck has noticed that the Danes are making a more sensible policy that also helps people. All he has to do is teach his party."
"21","NEUTRAL","The Greens are shaping the new concept of “socially ecological market economy”.
In view of the current socio-political ideas, I consider the term
“pseudo-ecological state socialism” for more appropriate."
"22","POSITIVE","I am very happy to see Robert Habeck become Chancellor. Finally, the remaining employees get some tolerance, the conventional farmers can go to the east and the buddies from Lusatia can go to Africa for the goblin safari, directly to the causes of escape."
"23","NEUTRAL","... Employees of the automotive industry..."
"24","NEUTRAL","As you can read, in Mainz, Mr. Köbler von den Grünen, Ortsvosteher of the Upper Town, is currently trying to prevent Xaver Naidoo's appearance for political reasons.
How far is that supposed to go? What about freedom of expression?
Book burns and limitations of artists we had and it seemed to be overcome."
"25","NEGATIVE","Wonders who should pay for all this.
It won't be the woman on the board of my small company.
Because I can't pay for that.
Dream castles of green would-be I-good-and-so-great to go on glue would be devastating.
Nevertheless, one would have the nasty desire to watch them as chancellor party at the end of the day"
"26","NEGATIVE","Beware of “artists “in leadership positions in the country. The simple knitting pattern thinking of these so-called elites carries the danger of despotism and megalomania. Habeck is the wolf in sheep's clothing."
"27","NEGATIVE","As you know, the pitcher goes to the well until it breaks!"
"28","NEUTRAL","Habeck gives the Merkel-Kretschmar. words and the attempt to occupy the “middle”. Let's see if the party does that. Meanwhile, the party has two big wings: the radical-ecological left-wing, which wants to massively transform society into a utopian ideal, and the reactionary Biedermeier wing, which sets itself up in a seeming idyll, drives SUV, Mercedes or Volvo and is particularly interested in organic, eco-and oneworld labels, in order to be the better people to be reported. The latter wing is more represented among the voters than in the party itself. When the Greens are in power, it will be difficult to operate both wings."
"29","MIXED","Clearly, the Greens want the greens, so so gendermal? , a communism in which the life of ordinary man becomes priceless.. through the beautiful and necessary regulations. If you don't see this, you'll feel it. Although, will feel it all.."
"30","NEUTRAL","Of course, it's not true, counter-example Baden-Württemberg. Or do you mean by communism good income and lowest unemployment?"
"31","NEUTRAL","Habeck's approach is still in the old socio-political ideas. The basic question is: how do we want to live tomorrow? And there the Greens as a party are still in between market economy - capitalism - and socialism in its modern variant, ecosocialism. They do not make the leap to real existing financial and digital capitalism, but are stuck on their wind turbines - the debate in the Bundestag was as small as yesterday. Otherwise, the first day reminded of a Protestant church day. Overall, the socio-political reflection on the distribution of labour and thus the distribution of productivity gains does not go further. Financial capitalism and its consequences, especially for the middle class, have not been really grasped, and instead they are fighting industry, the real economy, under the already harsh burdens of upheavals, while at the same time reversing globalisation and shifting the weights of global politics. At the same time, large parts of the Greens are threatening with the “decarbonization” of the economy and welfare state, thereby exacerbating precarization and impoverishment over the next 20 years. Whoever is interested in this, I recommend the contribution from 1999 (!!) by Peter Glotz, SPD, “Digital Capitalism”, in the edition of the Spiegel, No. 39/1999. The post is 20 years old, but seems to be up to date. 20 years of standstill!"
"32","NEUTRAL","That's how it is: At some point, you harvest what you've sown. So don't worry, reality has caught up with everyone so far..."
"33","NEUTRAL","@""At the Green Party Congress in Bielefeld, chairman Habeck speaks surprisingly thoughtful about the culture of debate.”

And that's why he wants the AfD to be watched by the Constitutional Protection, as the “Zeit” reported? I do not vote for the AfD (last I chose the FDP, earlier more often the CDU), but I think that the Greens and the AfD should be treated in the same way and be allowed to express themselves publicly. Citizens decide for themselves what they (we) have to think."
"34","NEUTRAL","But it depends on HOW to express you publicly. And there are many reasons to watch the afd"
"35","NEGATIVE","He can't."
"36","NEGATIVE","He can't.
He can do it.
He can't.
What are you doing? Don't you think that's silly, too? Is this supposed to serve a discussion? So without even the slightest explanation to get a sentence out?"
"37","NEUTRAL","Anyone who makes his cross among the Greens should be aware that at the latest after the 2021 elections, the cost of living will rise drastically: gasoline, heating, electricity, rents, flies will become priceless for many people, energetic refurbishments will expel many tenants from their homes"
"38","NEGATIVE","I see faithful clueless in Habeck's softened face.
Our prosperity is based on a hard, often unfair struggle for global markets.
You can't do it with El-Dei-Dei and throw money out the window..."
"39","NEGATIVE","The energy transition has given us the highest electricity prices in Europe. Our industry is being ruined. Next, more debts and nationalization. Socialism does not work, dear Greens. Mr Habeck does not know where the tax money comes from which the Greens want to waste. He did not even know how the commuter package works - what every employee knows."
"40","NEGATIVE","Habeck wants to build a socialist country without a “wall” and its green comraders do not go far enough. A green Chancellor would have the effect that a large number of well-qualified and half-young taxpayers would turn their backs on this country within a legislative period. Then D will no longer help new debts, then the lid will fly off the pot."
"41","POSITIVE","Will there soon be such a benevolent essay from the AfD class outing? There are also wings and extremes. And for me also essential issues, for which there is unfortunately no political alternative at present. 
I stick to my comparison of both parties - especially in their respective early stages. Who the Greens wanted to see everything liquidated in the '70s. Trittin even later in the last RAF victims...
I fear some commentators are right that there is a group of employees in the WORLD who want to present the Greens in a very beautiful light."
"42","NEUTRAL","“I fear some commentators are right that there is a group of employees in the WELT who want to present the Greens in a very beautiful light.”

But with this interview, WELT shows how to subtly induce a Habeck to talk about himself and his party. You have to acknowledge that."
"43","NEUTRAL","How much chalk did the Lord have breakfast before?"
"44","NEUTRAL","Habeck should urgently learn that a federal budget of almost €800 billion per year is also intended for investment and not just for consumptive expenditure. It should be borne in mind that tax revenues have already increased by 60% from 500 billion since 2006. 2 trillion of debt should be sufficient for the first time."
"45","NEUTRAL","If you look at the forecasts in the West, the Greens could actually represent the next chancellor, who, for quota reasons, will most likely be. How about one from the management level (e.g. from the Bundestag?
 People never learn, and things are still a little worse."
"46","NEUTRAL","Germany will not perish by the Greens, but growth will not come about with their ideas."
"47","POSITIVE","That's right with growth."
"48","NEUTRAL","Das isses: Captalism criticism in Ewin culture. And now we need “AKK”, which writes to its members this week about “Performance should be worthwhile” and fully textured on the line of the cabbage CDU (1976) and still fights like wild for “black and green”. What's that supposed to be? Two Rosamunde-Pilcher actors with their cleaning lady?"
"49","NEUTRAL","To me, Habeck is not trustworthy because he says that German schools are better than their reputation, but he sent his four sons all to private schools."
"50","POSITIVE","Certainly only because the connection to public transport is better there; -)"
"51","MIXED","Fine speeches are one thing, but concrete measures to restrict freedom of expression are the other, and Mr Habeck is undoubtedly a particularly opulent wolf in sheep's clothing."
"52","POSITIVE","If it's a cute wolf..."
"53","NEUTRAL","Until the election, the green hype is over and the 8.9% are more likely than the 20% of the current polls."
"54","POSITIVE","Hopefully, that's all you have to say"
"55","NEGATIVE","“Democracy is a dispute and part of the dispute is to also give the counterpart reasons for his positions. “If there are roars and silence, then we will no longer have democracy,” Habeck warns. He admits that “we Greens sometimes don't want to listen with a certain exuberance.”

Why doesn't anybody ask if this applies to AfD? Presumably 15% voters don't care Greens."
"56","NEUTRAL","In fact, this is the problem and shows how selfishness and tunnel vision dominates all those involved. After all, Habeck has at least indicated that he can critically question and change his position himself. This has become very rare! But this is the only way we can continue as a society that is currently disintegrating into various camps and stakeholders that only work against each other. Germany falls back and sinks into insignificance. Oswald Spengler says hello."
"57","NEGATIVE","When I think, I remember his words... that he can't do anything with Germany."
"58","NEUTRAL","If the chancellor were, you can't do anything with Germany."
"59","NEGATIVE","For the green as well as all other self-redemption religions, the destructive or evil is sociologically repairable. A false image of human beings is the problem of wrong politics."
"60","POSITIVE","Thank you for this little stroke of genius early in the morning."
"61","NEUTRAL","According to my undecisive impression, the green people currently have the smartest staff. Kretschmann, who does his job well and reasonably, was not trusted either. Funny people, we Germans. At least they seem willing or able to look beyond their own borders. Habeck as Chancellor - why not?"
"62","NEUTRAL","Maybe Habeck should talk to Kretschmann what it is like when you have responsibility."
"63","NEUTRAL","Indeed, the Greens currently have the most convincing staff and without them Germany will not be able to rule after the next BTW. It gets exciting when they come across reality. Either it rips them and the country or they really manage to lead Germany out of Merkel's lethargy. There are good arguments for both scenarios."
"64","NEUTRAL","Mr Habeck stands for a different policy.
A policy of “getting honest”, a policy that openly addresses where the problems of the FRG lie.
With him and Mrs. Baerbock, people know what's going on to them.
The GroKo also makes MMn good policy, but the differences between the Union and the SPD are too spongy.
The Greens make clear announcements, such as Mr Hofreiter, with the speed limit of 100 km/h on motorways.

A clear view of the upcoming changes.
“Habeck for Chancellors!”"
"65","NEGATIVE","No, Habeck will not be the new Chancellor. The people in our country are intelligent enough to fall for populist promises. It would be the decline of the economy and, therefore, sooner or later, of the social system. Merz, on the other hand, is certainly not easy, but he is characterised by the highest level of expertise and uncomfortable but honest statements. What I would like to leave to my children - a desolate economic system and a dilapidated social achievements or a professionally competent thinker who sometimes has the courage to tell uncomfortable truths, but brings Germany and the population forward, who rewards the risks of self-employment and the sober but honestly explained?!"
"66","NEGATIVE","I would like to have your positive attitude. Unfortunately, I cannot expect “intelligence” from the voters (influenced by the public media). To this end, a much larger proportion of the population would have to deal with politics."
"67","NEUTRAL","One will probably have to get used to it, Habeck will most likely become the next German Chancellor.
The majority of Germans want it this way, and the media will probably continue to do everything they can to make it happen. 
In other words, the corridor of opinion will probably not become wider and we will have to step by step abandon prosperity and accept the circumstances associated with deindustrialisation. 
Before that, all idealistic and moralistic thinking will not preserve us, and sooner or later the green bubble will burst and we will find ourselves on the ground of reality again."
"68","NEGATIVE","I don't look so apocalyptically at the future. Elections are still crucial and the Greens will not get much more than the 8.9% they received in the 2017 Bundestag election."
"69","NEGATIVE","GDR Party... totally blinded people who want to express their worldview!

I hope the USA & the Chinese are bursting the store! 

I don't care if I save abroad & one day when it gets too green I'm just gone."
"70","POSITIVE","Let's be honest: Habeck is the only alternative to Merkel or AKK. For the next 10 years, either the CDU/CSU or the Greens will put the chancellor. And I think Habeck would do a good job!"
"71","NEUTRAL","Depends on how to define the “good job”. Habeck is a communist in green sheep's clothing. Someone who has the word expropriation so easily can never become Chancellor of this country. Under Habeck, Germany would become a communist country with unprotected borders. For as he said, Whoever cometh here may remain. No, let's go."
"72","NEUTRAL","To them, the Greens would have to “exercise tolerance with ourselves”

The party that demands tolerance at all corners and ends and constantly proclaims a “tolerant society” must practice tolerance itself?
Find the error..."
"73","POSITIVE","Great commented! In short - this puts EVERYTHING to the point!"
"74","NEGATIVE","Spiritual speaker, handsome, currently unrivaled, demagogic, dangerous."
"75","NEUTRAL","Habeck ate chalk. Habeck wants Chancellor."
"76","POSITIVE","Thank you for this concise and purposeful formulation."
"77","NEGATIVE","Green and tolerance is something that, in my opinion, does not fit together."
"78","NEUTRAL","“Practice tolerance with ourselves”

That's what you learn in kindergarten. Habeck is 50 years old."
"79","NEUTRAL","Scrop on the head and well... That's where he moves with the rest."
"80","NEUTRAL","The wolf is putting on a sheepskin coat."
"81","NEGATIVE","Sounds like a bond from “The Wolf and the Seven Godlings” in which the wolf eats chalk...
Yeah, yeah. Habeck is at least a gifted children's book author..."
"82","NEUTRAL","Habeck also realizes that the strategy to go into negotiations with maximum demands in order to get out with the best possible result has turned into totalitarianism. I am counting myself to the group that is not willing to admit anything. Protection of the environment, just pensions and wages, protection and shelter of politically persecuted and fleeing from war are noble goals and an adornment of any society. But what we are experiencing in recent months and years is a perversion of these goals."
"83","NEGATIVE","Self-flagellation is more likely to hit."
"84","NEUTRAL","In Berlin, they work closely with the left in the direction of “car-free city”. There is nothing of tolerance, but only something of dictatorship. Accordingly, the appropriate “citizens' opinion” was designed: from the outset, it was determined how “More Kiez” should come about, precisely through fewer cars, ultimately without cars - this was presented in the event, how the “critical hints” in the GDR were treated: the target was set from the outset. and then it was only about how the plans etc. could be implemented even better.
More and more citizens are stealing the parking lots so that they can't hold cars anymore. What does this have to do with the current economic system? And with what right such figures reshape the economic system in its narrow, limited horizons — that does not fit the environment at all. But dictatorship is being exercised in the worst way again!"
"85","NEUTRAL","Gross domestic product has so far only measured “ecologically blind growth”. It should be changed into an index with softer criteria such as private care work or the countless hours of parenting at home

"86","POSITIVE","I think with all the politicians, the Tino Chrupalla seems much more sympathetic than this Habeck."
"87","NEGATIVE","Thinking bigger would be ok if it was not meant as the content of green politics. The Greens are deep red, have missed only a green paint and are therefore more dangerous than the left, which openly reveals itself. Both are in common that they are striving for an EU superstate with a global monoculture. National issues are declared obsolete."
"88","NEGATIVE","The Greens are not red. They're “Green Neoliberal.” With all green fronts, the small earner is disproportionately heavily burdened against the heavy earners. All cost increases (EEG levy, CO2 tax, etc.) are significantly more burdensome on the small earner. Who gets the most of his photovoltaic system, wind turbine or electric car sponsored by the “taxpayer”? Jupp, the ones who have enough money anyway. Not the minimum wage worker. “The Left” certainly do not want this!"
"89","NEGATIVE","It's too late for me. The Trojan horse has long been in the middle of Germany. It is painted green and it is empty. The warriors have long taken their seats. Troy is lost."
"90","POSITIVE","Very well described. Absolutely true!"
"91","NEUTRAL","After the glossy interview yesterday, two reports on the party congress of the current IT party? Is this habeckization really necessary? Sometimes you feel like you're here in the party organ of the Greens. From the next party congress of the FDP, I would like to request a high-gloss interview with Mrs Teuteberg, a 16-minute snippet of Mr Lindner's speech and two editorial contributions to his speech. Finally, the FDP finished in the last Bundestag election comparable to the Greens. And the two liberals also have more to say than Mr Habeck with his pseudo-philosophical squadron, which remains approximate in almost all areas and otherwise propagates a tight eco-socialism."

"94","MIXED","I'm afraid you do."
"95","NEGATIVE","What does this Mr. Habeck want? I don't understand. Funny guy, definitely. The management of a primary school or a nature conservation association is better not to be entrusted to him. Wouldn't feel good about that. Honestly."

Claudia Roth is practicing to dimmer her general outrage.
Göring-Eckardt is practicing not to mob Mr. Özdemir away.

Mr Habeck has tolerance towards those who simply do not like him and accepts that he can not only convince as a green womanizer with a three-day style.

"102","NEUTRAL","Habeck will not become Chancellor. Look at Austria, there's a black (okay, they're turquoise) -green coalition. In Austria, political developments happen earlier, which was also the case with right-wing populism. It was there 20 years ago with Haider. Developments happen there earlier, because the small country is more mobile than the rather rigid colossus Germany. 
In Germany everything happens with delay. This is not only the case in politics, but also in the economy. Technologically, you are quite a long way back, pacemaker technologies do not arise here, you are just “followers”. It's a good thing that someone like Elon Musk shows up here, you could use more of that kind."

The chancellor calculus of H. could then only get in the way of the female quota in the form of candidate B. or, as a novelty, the “part-time chancellor”.

In Germany, things must always be very bad before things can get better."

The CDU only needs to say goodbye to its own socialism as soon as possible and, together with the Liberals, to remember its core competences without disregarding ecology, Jamaica could do something really good for our country, everything else would be just a standstill."
"122","MIXED","A new era begins. Very sympathetic to the two. At the Ana-Lena it still has a bit, but the Habeck not only looks good, but also can talk well. Content doesn't really interest. What revolts me, however, is that the CDU seems to give up. Mr Merz is no longer helping."
"123","NEUTRAL","Why does that revolt her? The CDU wants it this way, if you have ever sat with your CDU deputy in the civic office hour and asked him how it can be that his party brings nearly three million eternal social welfare recipients into the country and at the same time wants to explain to the citizen that this can not be done differently, even that this group of people is a profit for society and social systems?
I did this, in very polite words, the man almost freaked out as I could dare ask such questions...
(As I learned later, this Member is supposed to be the owner of two small homes for which a rent per bed of 400€/month is paid.)

No, it's not a pity about the CDU and yes until 2009 I was still a half-satisfied voter."
"124","NEUTRAL","It's getting contemplative. One of the smallest parties in the Bundestag gets the stage of the big ones."
"125","POSITIVE","Guess who's using this."
"126","NEGATIVE","The party supposedly wants €40 per ton of CO2, Fridays for Future wants €180 per ton of CO2. 
I'm angry when the Greens rule first. The cost of various food etc. will increase."
"127","NEUTRAL","@Herr - To the 180€per ton you should also get there. What do you notice? Three cents or 54 per liter of gasoline?"
"128","NEUTRAL","“Green opening speech by Robert Habeck (Federal Chairman) in Bielefeld”:
https://youtu.be/HEA3n9acVMA
Habeck: “Who sets the course in this new era?
“... make a reality out of hope”
But first sentence: “... the party congress takes place in front of a great horizon, where major pressing and urgent problems have emerged - global warming, global heating assumes the existence-threatening proportions.”

So in the welcome sentence he speaks of ERDEHISZUNZING - in my case my mind heats up rather slightly, but it is applauded diligently. I admit, he understands his craft - the language and the conveying of theatrical aspects and contents, and if you listen closely and look, there is a lot to read out. 

(... but only 5'the 37', looked at me and my, some young people do not understand psychological effects yet and some adults also do not, that is his success, respectively makes “with” his success!?)"
"129","NEGATIVE","Green is not honest. And if I am in Hamburg cyclists on the footpath certainly do not threaten. Just one example
Progress does not mean back to the Middle Ages"
"130","NEGATIVE","From us, motorists threaten me when I'm on foot. I'm more afraid of them than “bicycle rambos”."
"131","NEUTRAL","With the GREEN, everything is guaranteed to be much more complicated, more expensive and more unfriendly. Because this party of rich townspeople and educated citizens only creates new problems and does not solve old ones."
"132","POSITIVE","We have quite different experiences there in BaWü. 
And education hasn't hurt anyone yet, try it away from Wikipedia and YouTube."
"133","POSITIVE","Black-green becomes salonable sometime, because 20 years ago you laughed. Nobody laughs now because RRG is the new extreme."
"134","NEGATIVE","An apocalyptic speech without a spirit of excitement."
"135","NEUTRAL","Concentred three articles at the same time about one party. Does this allow certain conclusions about preferences? Anyway, I haven't heard anything new."
"136","POSITIVE","You don't want to doubt the comprehensive and objective information of Wo?"
"137","NEUTRAL","If the chancellor becomes Germany's history."
"138","NEUTRAL","Why do you mean that?"
"139","NEGATIVE","Of the first four articles on Welt.de again 3 about the Greens.
This party is granted a presence which allows an absolute majority to be accepted and not 9%.
I really don't know why I still support this site?
Probably because of Broder, the Don and one or two other editors."
"140","POSITIVE","Greta will soon be back, then the daily Thunberg coverage will be resumed. Promise!”"
"141","NEUTRAL","Exercise tolerance? From the citizen is called for! 
Apart from the elaborated, fewer, wages."
"142","NEUTRAL","always sea punctuation marks"
"143","NEGATIVE","He can't start with Germany!!"
"144","NEUTRAL","That is why we now have the EURO and not the DM anymore. Unfortunately, this one does not keep a promise. That's why approval by the Pfründen."
"145","NEUTRAL","There are no candidates against Baerbock and Habeck;
Germany is lost..."
"146","POSITIVE","“If there are roars and silence, then we will no longer have democracy”
I wouldn't have assigned such a clever spell to him.
I'm silent... and I vote for AfD."
"147","NEUTRAL","“I'm silent... and I vote for AfD.”
I do, too, with a fist in my pocket.

Today, the German government “bought up” the print media with €100 million. With only €100 million, as the print media had demanded €500 million more. So that they can reach old people even in the countryside by distributing their leaves and “one-north”, as we say.

And then the matter with Amri and the involvement of the federal government today.

Guys: We're being fiddled! Of those who were elected!"
"148","NEUTRAL","“What did the radical climate protectors want to block, here in Bielefeld, at the Green Party Congress?”
If they were serious about climate protection, they could, for example, point out to the green that it is counterproductive to shut down our nuclear power plants in front of our coal-fired power plants."
"149","POSITIVE","So you know exactly how and where the radioactive waste can be safely deposited for the next 1000 years. Maybe very close to you. I'm sure you'd appreciate that. I'm sure of that."
"150","POSITIVE","No matter which politician says anything about other politicians or parties, it is always interesting to apply the law of projection. Then you come up with amazing results and insights."
