"1","NEGATIVE","Short announcement: Anyone who thinks to insult the author will be blocked."
"2","NEUTRAL","I got police!"
"3","POSITIVE","Dear Fr√©d√©rik Schwilden. You invent something like that, or it really happened. I would have guessed you in first class. Personally, I had not had to gain such experiences on the train - thank God - yet. On the contrary: rest, or conversations or mothers with their children I see what you don't see and it is... For me, this is the social center. They describe a few young people who express their energy surplus in socially dubious form. But degrading them to potential criminals? Your arrogance about the future career profiles? Ts Ts Ts. And what did they mean by using drugs and having sex? On the street, in the rehab clinic or just a harmless joint? Guys are here. You should already have some general education. And if your own government imports ‚Äúpeople‚Äù who have cut others's necks, raped and tortured, cannot even be held accountable because there is no evidence... Let the youth celebrate. Only a few people in this country are punishable."
"4","POSITIVE","These bieder-bourgeois football fans are the ones that will keep Germany running in the future. Precisely because they are so bodily and conscientiously do their daily work. To me as a woman, these football songs growling medium-sized companies prefer to read so many other passengers. I even feel safer with them on the train than without them."
"5","NEUTRAL","Do you have children yourself, Mr. Journalist?
Have you ever listened to the lyrics of any rapper correctly? 
Do you think the fact that young people who are training and don't use drugs are bad?"
"6","POSITIVE","I recently drove on a train on a weekend where a lot of young people drove to Cannstatter Wasen. Since I am not particularly interested in this festival, I did not think that it will take place in Stuttgart on the weekend. The dressed young people fell in the train station, some were already drunk, and during the trip was diligently drunk. Beer cans rolled empty through the train, it was sound by means of Bluetooth - boxes anyone who wanted or didn't want party music in deafening volume. The doors were not kept open, the train could only reach its destination with delay. As much as you give the young people their fun, their sheer recklessness not only annoys, but also makes them angry. In this respect, I can understand the author. What I absolutely can't understand is this artificial panning to humps or refugees who may feel threatened. Also, that on the skin color of the young people is ridden around and their clothes, I feel superficial. The author thus shows that he suffers from precisely the prejudice he seemingly tries to impose on others artificially. There are enough reasons to get angry about drunken party goers: the garbage, the noise, the ruthlessness and the nonsense they give away. But to create raccists who want to frighten women and refugees with brutal songs, I find that extremely dragged by the hair."
"7","POSITIVE","I totally agree with you, the author criticizes something of which he then makes use of himself and by his commentary ‚ÄúI have police!‚Äù shows how much he accepts criticism."
"8","NEGATIVE","What an incredibly arrogant, inhumane and alien stud, who is out of his own echo chamber with the cheapest applause. So future bank racks and dental assistants are the ugly Germans, because they let the sow out in a party mood what young people think. Doesn't everyone fit in your morally overwhelming drawer and that's good? What do you have to offer besides an extremely narcistic indignation as a constructive contribution to society?"
"9","NEUTRAL","Which generation wasn't afraid of the next one?"
"10","NEGATIVE","‚ÄúWhen I see you, I'm scared. Not right in front of you, but from what's inside you, what you're letting out now. Why are you singing about hanging, slicing the belly. Why do you want everyone to hear that? ‚Äú

So the author - and with the question attached - it is the same as with the other train passengers: is not my problem why< - oder hier die R√ºckfrage: >everyone? We hear ourselves, that's enough. And if in the football stadium, then it's the counter-fans - quite so<
So I see the core of the problem - the radical, empathy-free selfishness, as an individual and as a bubble group. And this is described with such a psychological explanation only superficially - this goes much deeper."
"11","POSITIVE","Emphatiefree selfishness! Thank you for this expression!"
"12","POSITIVE","In one of your last contributions ‚Äî it was about Mrs Musi ‚Äî you wrote: ‚ÄúAgainst the Eternal Yesterday best helps: love, love and again love.‚Äù Satire forbade himself in this context, so you obviously meant it seriously.
Well, you obviously have overcome this stage of thinking. There is nothing more about love, love and again love in your post. The young people who drink alcohol, sing bad songs, training and wearing the wrong clothes fall through - all the way. You're ‚Äúugly Germans‚Äù! Don't take proper drugs, and don't even listen to music like ‚ÄúMy Pussy tastes like Pepsi Cola‚Äù by Lana Del Rey. You love Lana Del Rey, of course, and you won't be underneath it. 
All in all, a one-sided, offensive and arrogable contribution. 
PS: Not that I would particularly appreciate such young people, but the way in which you are expressing yourself here is, do we say, questionable?"
"13","POSITIVE","Very well written. Corresponds to what I often experience when driving a train (Greater Frankfurt area). But what is still missing is the detailed description of the great rest of the train: no intervention, but looking away - yes. But: The daily humiliations of Deutsche Bahn are also implicitly accepted. There the office seaters, careerists, etc. sit around like pious lambs and let everything pass. As long as you can comfort yourself with the Internet and the SUV at the commuter station, the world seems to be fine. The ‚Äúmiddle of society‚Äù has no interest in opposing the excesses of the middle, as well as the excesses of the DB misplanning. We live in a society where only one's own consumption counts. And the state has long abandoned the regulatory framework anyway. First the shutdown of the police numbers, then the recording of other classes of society."
"14","NEGATIVE","I don't realize what a group of low-educated young people has to do with Bjoern Hoecke? You won't be calling for violence from him. Do they both come in the drawer with the inscription ‚Äúunpleasant fellow buriers‚Äù, even if they have nothing else to do with each other? Or, even more simplified, in the drawer Ossis = Nazis? I understand the unease of the author on the train, but I believe that lump-ups do not help us."
"15","NEUTRAL","Then I like to be a Nazi... üôà because I like to be an East German!

Drawer down!"
"16","NEGATIVE","These people are ordinary citizens who don't meet in MacBook Cafes in Berlin Mitte or Munich Schwabing. That's life. I find the text cynical and condescending."
"17","NEUTRAL","So taking drug is better. Who do you think decay here? When I was over 70 years old, I am with the young people who, sometimes beat the strands, do their training and otherwise are fine."
"18","MIXED","That's right! 
Because who was not a teenager himself and did nonsense? Of course, the chants are such a thing, but I think if you would listen to every text of various rappers, the catch songs are more of a kindergarten!"
"19","NEGATIVE","I could write a lot about this author's statement of opinion, but the most important thing is that no one is entitled to judge and degrade these people. Not even to a journalist. There is no company that is pretty Apple compatible to order on Amazon, with 14 days return policy. The Die Welt that publishes here annoys me. I always tell people that this newspaper is not as superficially pseudo correct as most sheets in D. My advice: TRAVEL! Then you will have a better overview of the people and how they behave on planet Earth."
"20","POSITIVE","Does the author actually think it's a good idea to address a group of growling, drunk youth on the train to their behavior? 

I really find the annihilation of such songs as ‚Äújust fun‚Äù."
"21","NEGATIVE","For me, public transport is unpleasant because such threatening events are blooming from all directions. It's not just Germans who can and want to lend you the ride. Such subliminal aggressive behaviors, or even more, I call testing limits. Ba's train staff is overwhelmed and the executive is on the way. Completely normal also that football fans destroy trains. It's strange that neither the Greens nor their NGOs are dealing with this problem. Apparently, from their point of view, we have no right to undisturbed and stress-free travel by public transport. But take the car? Or should the ordinary traveller be shown that he or she are effectively abandoned from all sides?"
"22","NEGATIVE","Yeah, that's not nice. 
But: even those who simply function economically in this country have a dark side. And I think a right to occasionally let the sow out.
After all, they pay their drugs with their own money. Middle-class parents do not have the means at all. Bring kids out of really gross problems. This makes it easier for the upper class, the lower class with legal aid (by the way, the middle class also pays for that). The refugees, by the way, too. 

In Turkey, America and the UK, too, the whole story began with these horrible election results with the disdain of the normal middle class. Here it is the dentist assistant and the mechatronic. In Turkey, the peasant woman with a headscarf and the truck driver. They may not be the brightest and the most politically conscious. This should be accepted and given them their shortcomings too. The elites and those who are dragged along economically (unemployed, refugees) are admitted and accepted their weaknesses.

Whoever so despises the middle class, with all its dark sides and fears, leaves it to the pie-catchers. And the middle class may not be able to put it well in words - but it can feel the contempt. 

There is no need to be surprised about terrible election results, whether in Thuringia, America or Turkey."
"23","NEGATIVE","I don't think such songs are okay either. BUT you also have to keep the ball a bit flat. Of youthful football fans who ‚Äúhang them up‚Äù, sing ‚Äúsons of bitches‚Äù or spray ‚ÄúACAB‚Äù, the very little ones are criminal. This is simply bad education, no more and no less (my parents would have ‚Äútold‚Äù something to me, nonverbal if I had sung such things).

The real criminal, murderers and defilers don't sing. Not like that. The murders and desecrates, mostly without being told or told before. 

I think H√∂cke (who does not sing such songs to my knowledge) is far more dangerous than these young people, and throwing them in a pot with him, well..."
"24","POSITIVE","... we were all once young... and roar on the train or on foot after the disco or after the youth dance... from today's point of view... songs that resembled the described... ‚Äúcome we eat a corpse... etc ‚Äú... in the bus that sometimes drove us home it was different... that the bus driver the rioter with a kick in the The bus driver gained social recognition... over the last two generations our society has transformed socio-cultural into a smelly abort pit through the general failure of the flat governments and the growing depravity of the media... also the abolition of military service was a big mistake... on the other hand, the author of this article denounces... albeit in his postulated virtual thoughts... these young people as the antagonists... who certainly are not... with the spell of Giovanni Trappatoni... whom I admire with esteem... I want to conclude: ‚Äú... what allow Strunz!?? ‚Äú"
"25","NEGATIVE","What do you want me to draw from this?
They perform without manners, could just as well be razed when they were addressed - wouldn't be the first time. Then in the article the excitement at the reader is shut down. You could feel pity right away. Free according to Horst Schl√§mmer ‚ÄúI don't want this‚Äù"
"26","NEGATIVE","Sorry, after about 100 comments...
yes there is worse and a pity that the article is quite exaggerated. Still, it's not beautiful. As a teenager, I probably did nonsense, but had respect for adults and not this exaggerated self-confident attitude."
"27","POSITIVE","I think it's very courageous to address such a bunch of teens. But they actually reacted quite sensibly. It's always hard to judge when you weren't there, but I think there are more drastic cases."
"28","NEGATIVE","This has already existed in my childhood, for example against hated football clubs. Completely harmless. To seriously interpret this as ‚Äúcalling for murder,‚Äù I find it absurd."
"29","POSITIVE","The most biederste of all was the author of this article. He doesn't realize that such massive biederness always has a shadow side. Of course, you can sometimes get bad with all the swords and roars of disgusted skewers in trains - even as a child this caused me to fear the suburban trains of my home region at the weekend. But better they let it out like that, without personal injury or property damage. As the ‚Äúdentist assistant‚Äù said, it's not serious. It is a constantly suppressed, natural, aggressive impulses by people who otherwise make upbringing and repressive environment impossible any spontaneous excitement. According to the motto: Woe when they let go. And at home, they again wallpaper the kitchen table from below, in the profession they snuggle. As an adult, one should know and understand this and be able to distinguish it from actual violence."
"30","NEUTRAL","When I overfly the comment column here I find: F. Swilden is right. Even the so-called middle of society is practiced in relativizing and ‚Äúis not meant so‚Äù. Then why do you pronounce it? Just to provoke? In this case the song was sung on the train, which is intended for the neighbouring village. Why is this harassing the train community?"
"31","NEGATIVE","Why does Mrs. Del Rey sing about what soft drink her primary sex organ tastes like? And why does the author listen to this song, and even writes about loving the singer. Where do you see the border reached? Can you imagine that some people already feel reproached by Mrs Del Rey's song?"
"32","NEGATIVE","Not very nice, but I'm more afraid of people who are in favour of occupations, climate activism, or against gentrification and capitalism. Because they don't just sing stupid songs, they also like to use violence. Whether it's local residents, employees of housing companies or policemen."
"33","MIXED","‚ÄúAnd I ask them why they don't just take drugs and have sex like other teenagers instead of singing ‚Äúhang‚Äù on the train. And then a guy looks at me totally irritated. ‚ÄúAre you crazy?‚Äù ‚Äú
I find this attitude of the young people almost exemplary. As if ‚Äútaking drugs‚Äù and ‚Äúhaving sex‚Äù were the most obvious things for teenagers. Luckily doesn't seem like that yet.

But then the panning to: ‚ÄúI think of Bj√∂rn H√∂cke and that not the extremes are the dangerous.‚Äù What was that good for now? They sing football songs, which would also bother me, I just wrote it as a comment on the group rape article, that groups were always suspicious, rustling or drunken ones, and I can only disapprove the choice of words here, but what do these football songs with Mr. H√∂cke have at once? do it? Did he write it?"
"34","NEGATIVE","I think and hope that the young people described are not the middle-class middle class, but primary pupils without graduation and education, that is, the next generation of H4. Admittedly, this is also not beautiful and does not make the edge of society better!"
"35","NEUTRAL","You think as the main student will collect all H4? oh oh oh oh oh
beautiful new world. The main pupils are a normal part of the taxpayer citizens of this country. You too?"
"36","POSITIVE","These kids get on my nerves too. But they're farther from H√∂cke and Co. than Earth from Mars. I'm already looking forward to the next train report: best through the Ruhr area, in the evening from Dortmund to Essen. Have fun."
"37","POSITIVE","I like the author. He always writes in such a way that a certain type of reader feels vicariously attacked."
"38","POSITIVE","Dear Jens-Dieter Salinger,

Thank you for your comment.

A great forum name, by the way!

And among us: This is exactly what I write: to step on the feet of the right people.

Best regards,

Your Fr√©d√©ric Schwilden"
"39","POSITIVE","Thank you. That's exactly what I experienced between Nieb√ºll and Altona. Nobody dares to say anything. This is precisely the endangered (Dangerous) who fall into the light of Nazi claims."
"40","POSITIVE","A very true, but also very good article.
And the reaction of the reflexapologists in the comments (‚ÄúThis is quite normal! That's not bad!‚Äù) I would like to see Mr Schwilden had not described the ethnicity of young people in such detail."
"41","POSITIVE","Dear Sialin,

Thank you for your comment.

I don't understand the reactions either. Same behaviour with dark skin color and the calls for ‚Äúdeportation‚Äù would have become loud. It's crazy how people feel attacked by describing facts.

Thank you for your words.

Best regards,

Your Fr√©d√©ric Schwilden"
"42","NEGATIVE","Sounds like an ordinary train ride on the weekend."
"43","POSITIVE","üòÑ good comment that says everything"
"44","NEGATIVE","The topic: ‚ÄúHow do I imagine how to interact with each other in public space? , was unfortunately missed by the author, whereby that would be really worth investigating, as a user of the S-Bahn I can sing a song of it...
It has to do with groups, lack of respect for others and unprecedented selfishness. 
Ugly German? The causal chain, young people singing from borderline songs to the AfD does not seem to be given to me, I see the cause rather in the absence of education (the kids reacted rather surprised, had no sense of guilt).
By the way, dental assistant and savings bank employees are honorable professions, especially the former will need the author at some point..."
"45","MIXED","Celebrating is not a problem - but leaving such a crap, both musically and in fact - that's really Sch...! But this also applies to another side of the young generation (who like to listen to violent glorifying, drug-friendly, splurking and sexist rap songs). From which minimalism side the real violence now emanates, let's see."
"46","POSITIVE","Mr. Schwilden, I am a pensioner myself. But as a contrast program, I recommend a bus ride with only pensioners on board. Best for a long time, to Spain or Italy. I'd be interested in your findings.
.
It is not just incidents like the one in which the bus driver, while the ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù sits in the garden restaurant in Rome, is asked to bring out the wine brought in in the luggage room.
.
By the way, my findings go to the fact that I wonder how these people have successfully achieved a whole professional life."
"47","POSITIVE","Dear DDH,

Thank you for your comment.

Do you want to take me on a bus ride and I'll write about it? 

Feel free to write to frederic.schwilden@welt.de

I'm glad to hear from you.

With the best regards,

Your Fr√©d√©ric Schwilden"
"48","POSITIVE","Dear Frederuc with accent aigu, it will be exciting for her when her son gets older... 
Children very much like to oppose in their natural urge to freedom in one direction or another"
"49","POSITIVE","Dear Rudolf G.

Thank you for your comment.

I'm also very excited to see how my son is developing. But I'm optimistic.

Shocking me would only be if he played football. But that wouldn't be doomed either. I'm tolerant.

Best regards,

Your Fr√©d√©ric Schwilden"
"50","POSITIVE","Not so much judging and breathing a little looser through my pants would be my serious and loving advice to Mr. Schwilden, which I highly esteemed. 

Growing up in this world, with all its impressions, always being politically correct, is impossible for most. And most of them would, just a day later, be ashamed of some. Some years may pass with others. But society does not perish, on the contrary, it has always been so."
"51","NEUTRAL","Always revealing when you leave your own bubble. Maybe for a journalist, for a matter of course, or not?"
"52","POSITIVE","Nice that someone sees the problem of succession generations also... deaf for feelings, respect and decence.Look at it on my own And do everything to control against it. The influence from outside is just ugly and freezing..."
"53","NEGATIVE","Bissel exaggerated. Teenagers are just like that. Most later become decent adults."
"54","NEGATIVE","So, performing yourself like this in public space is certainly a thing that is unpleasant to anyone who has to experience it. But drawing a reference to the entire German middle class (including the future) is insulting. 
There are such ‚Äúugly‚Äù people all over the world, and Germany has not leased them. 
However, I would like to strongly oppose such a generalization.

If the author felt so uncomfortable on the train, why didn't he change the wagon?
The whole thing is, by the way, a reason why I don't like train driving."
"55","NEGATIVE","I don't like drunk people growling around. But the ideas that come to the author are somewhat disturbing. Does he think dark-skinned people don't sing stupid songs when they're drunk? Why is it so important to him that they are white?"
"56","POSITIVE","Good afternoon Mr. Schwilden,
Did you listen to the lyrics of the bands playing there at a concert against the right? With the applause of the inhabiting federal politicians!
Partly broadcast live in the √ñR.
No, or just heard away because it didn't fit in the picture."
"57","POSITIVE","Dear Christian S.,

Thank you for your comment.

I didn't think so well.

Best regards,

Your Fr√©d√©ric Schwilden"
"58","NEGATIVE","Ohh fright to most who comment here. Why don't you take the author's sensations seriously? Is the only one opinion valid and that's right? Why is the author bled for his emotions?"
"59","NEGATIVE","It's not sentiments, it's convictions. And this is the problem"
"60","NEUTRAL","How did you hear that if you wanted to listen to music via headphones?"
"61","POSITIVE","If you don't just turn the music up to ‚Äúdie-ear-bleed‚Äù volume, you'll still get enough of your surroundings."
"62","NEGATIVE","Freedom has risks and side effects that sometimes displeasure. Just keep it loose."
"63","POSITIVE","Dear Holger S.,

Thank you for your comment.

Freedom ceases where it limits the fundamental rights of others. And a society is not good where you sing off the belly, and you don't realize how crazy it is.

Best regards,

Your Fr√©d√©ric Schwilden"
"64","NEGATIVE","*omg*
Or Kafkaesk?
I'm kind of sorry about the author. He apparently fell from the moon to earth yesterday, does not know how to happen to him and makes himself far-fetched, sometimes really pitiful rhymes on it.

Perhaps some can remember naive-moron classmates, etc., who always misunderstood everything and then ‚Äúratted‚Äù at the teacher: ‚ÄúThe Erik said that the Emil is lesbian!‚Äù 
There the strangely touched teacher - here now the readers.

Or an ancient prof who drove with us students (apparently the first time after a long time) through the area by bus and wondered about everything he did not understand and considered the ‚Äúmost amusing‚Äù explanations for this from his brain and ‚Äúexplained‚Äù to the people - we were really ashamed: ‚ÄúWhat kind of strange bowls have people there? on the roof?‚Äù
‚ÄúThese are satellite dishes, Mr. Professor, have been receiving television for many years.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhatever there is not all... With bowls you watch TV today - that's not healthy!‚Äù

In addition, the constant reductions and even insults of the young people, although they explained to him several times and he also understood that this was a misunderstanding on his part: One really has to ask oneself what problems the poor author might carry around with him..."
"65","NEGATIVE","These were certainly the same average types, who drink and rowl at the ballermann and think that for holidays, drink and rowl in the stadium and think that for sport, or drink and rowl in the beer tent in Munich and consider this a tradition. At a certain level, they obviously don't care about the text."
"66","POSITIVE","Then it's good that you and the author are different from that average. There are two options where you can settle. Above or below the average. I have decided üòâ"
"67","NEGATIVE","All right and you really can not say anything against the author's criticism.
But as a young person drinking alcohol and doing nonsense unfortunately happens.... and if you didn't do it yourself, I'm sorry anyway."
"68","NEUTRAL","This is not the bourgeois centre, but only medium-sized with underclass background."
"69","NEGATIVE","Even if the side blow is drawn to the AfD on the hair. You just have to imagine how the comment column would look here if it had been a group of Arabic-stemmed teenagers who would have scanted something of bellies and hung up. I wonder if this would have been excused by drinking alcohol, adolescent age and the somewhat 'simpler origin'? Whether the author would have been pulled off as a wimp or snob?"
"70","POSITIVE","Dear Markus K.

Thank you for your comment!

Exactly the same question I asked myself.

Best regards,

Your Fr√©d√©ric Schwilden"
"71","NEGATIVE","I don't know why so many are upset about this article?

The author's thesis is: Usually we expect something like bad behavior (I don't define anymore), decay or socially unaccepted behavior at the political margins or from Millieus, which are usually labelled as ‚Äúeducational‚Äù or ‚ÄúHartz IV‚Äù etc. But the reality check of a train journey already shows: No, the ceiling of good citizenship is thin, and something like that quickly meets you from there, from the so-called middle. Of course, without hard drugs, but with a lot of alcohol, noise and ruthlessness. And it doesn't matter if the kids come from a football match or a party.

And what is wrong with pointing out that it is not a sign of decency for young people to let themselves go full, sing tasteless songs, soak in public toilets and sound whole railway wagons? A society that rightly complains more and more about decay should perhaps be more sensitive to such misconduct. At that age, the kids should have learned from whoever ever has, that something like this is wrong. And if someone thinks that everything is not so bad: this may be the cause of the problem. Fun is different!"
"72","POSITIVE","Very good comment!"
"73","POSITIVE","Someone has experienced a real cultural shock! 

I assume that what the good gentleman heard was something like this:

'in xyd, there are corpses
With slit bellies
and in their bellies
there are knives
with the inscription:

‚ÄúWe were better!‚Äù
Ole, Ole, Ole, Ole

The taste can now be argued. Nevertheless, I assume 100% that none of the poor people on the train, who have now actually been exposed by the author, actually mean it seriously. That's how much basic confidence in people should be. Football has still retained a certain proletarian nature, and there is no need to respect every convention, makes it so popular.

As for the rest, my goodness, young people get drunk on their way to or from a party on the train. And that in North Rhine-Westphalia. I wonder what a bell you have to live under in order to have never seen anything like this before. Do I often find that annoying on the train? Of course I do. Do I really have to be upset about this? Of course not, because firstly, I did this myself in the past and still today I often ride with a beer to parties or to football matches. Then I don't get upset about those who do geiches - or go to a rock concert, to a medieval festival, to a techno spectacle, to a pop move celebrating their bachelor party or whatever. This' ignorance 'criticized by the author is the' tolerance 'which he calls for himself - ridiously in relation to hard drugs.

That is, the plegte beer you are socializing with in the village is suspicious - but a couple of funny pillets with a smily on it are typical? And of course, you can only have sex in the Berghain, but no case with people from village. The emperor probably had so much dimse at the last time, if he had reached the slums of Berlin..."
"74","NEGATIVE","Anyone who gets excited now did not necessarily understand the author. It is precisely the flaunted ignorance that amazes you again and again. If a group of ‚Äúmen‚Äù had joined, the young people singing about battles would have been quite silent. The same thing would have happened with a group of neo-Nazis. It's just this hollow behavior that excites you because it allows the emergence of extremes once in the middle. Whether left or right."
"75","NEUTRAL","Sorry, Chistian M., but I understood Zero what you're trying to say with your post."
"76","NEGATIVE","I don't know if I'm in the middle of Germany. I don't think so. The other day, I drove football hooligans wearing their badges, their shawls, I freed a place for one of them. They drank canned beer, so they did something that is already forbidden in many lanes. The people who come home from their Hartz 4 job can't even drink their evening beer on the train. It's almost criminalized. These football fans were even worse: one had his smartphone with songs, another had such a portable speaker, and then they played the whole car together. With harmless hits from the canned. But these harmless, nice people, over whom other passengers ruffled their nose because they stood out as noise-makers, were not the middle. I wait until I finally meet the middle, and then I write a biting comment on welt.de!
The middle of the jungle book: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXU01iMXhWg"
"77","NEGATIVE","So that was now the middle of society?????"
"78","NEUTRAL","Many people are now hypersensitized, both on the right and on the left. Braids are suddenly identifying, to people with dark complexion you suddenly make a bow. 

Scenes from my everyday life: In a conversation with a former colleague, I was suddenly suspected ‚Äúin the fun‚Äù of right sentiment because I used the word ‚Äúdepopulated‚Äù in connection with dying inner cities. 
In a pedestrian zone, after 20 people, I was the only one who stopped when a foreigner tried to address passers-by. Everyone raised their hands defensively or made a bow around him. He just asked about the way and thanked him very much for helping him. His English was perfect. 

I'm afraid it's got really bad."
"79","NEUTRAL","@ Ulrich K: I can agree with your statement and the examples mentioned above and I often encounter similar things again and again. Increasingly large parts of the German language are taboo or automatically linked with an imposition. The fact that language is the tool of our thoughts and must therefore be used as accurately and thoughtfully as possible is undoubtedly right. Examples: repopulating, xenophobic, ethnic, European haters, system parties, racist, extraneous alienation. In order to overcome the growing mutual speechlessness expressed in such allegations, the current politicians in Germany (and Europe) must match democratic and well-deserved speech with concrete political action."
"80","NEGATIVE","That such behavior is extremely unpleasing: no question! You have to tolerate this: no. Is this dangerous for a society? Maybe, maybe it helps the poeblers to relieve any tension.
Are there people who shouldn't be so frank about their behavior in the web? Oh, yes!! And we should talk about them."
"81","NEGATIVE","That's exactly what I think. The real problem is, for example, growling football fans, whom you regularly encounter as a train driver. Strangely enough, the author has never encountered such things, or he has rather not addressed them."
"82","NEUTRAL","Such articles arise when jounalists see themselves as activists and opinion makers/educators."
"83","POSITIVE","Mr Schwilden's articles are always the same.
I like to read it very much because it gives me a perspective in which I usually end up with question marks above my head, but which gives me insights into the way of thinking of more emotional people."
"84","NEUTRAL","It's always the same when I drive a train. The young people lie their dirty feet on their seats and there is no room for the elderly. The normal average citizen is often also to blame for the delay of the German railways. It does not need extremes for this situation. And that can be found all over Germany. I prefer to get in my car and have probably nothing is dirty or full of bacilli or the toilets are dirty. I can choose where to stop myself. The Deutsche Bahn is only as good as the public. This can be changed with train tickets which are free also not quite the contrary it gets even worse"
"85","NEUTRAL","Train regularly. But the problem is not necessarily the young people. And keep driving for a while. Not that we meet again, and who knows what you're doing, which brings me to the palm tree."
"86","POSITIVE","When I drive through Berlin at night, I see and hear groups of young people from all over the world... and I'm glad I don't understand everything...
So, it has nothing to do with the color of the skin or with the AfD... It is not a matter of origin, but rather a generational phenomenon. 
We weren't angels in the past."
"87","NEGATIVE","It's funny that the author describes young people who come from HIS milieu. In discussing rather than educated and left-oriented helicopter parents, such a thing often comes out. So these are by no means the rights of tomorrow, but the same children who cut school for the environment on Fridays.
So what does the author want to tell us with his parallels to H√∂cke und Co.??"
"88","POSITIVE","Mr. Schwillden, out of interest, you'd rather drive around Berlin at night with the public.
Good entertainment!"
"89","NEUTRAL","How are these ‚ÄúWhite Trash‚Äù young people related to the AFD? Just ask me this way..."
"90","NEGATIVE","Stupidity, group and suff, that's what they find everywhere in this country, not just in the Sauerland. The combination, in fact, is dangerous. Thank you for this insight into the abysses of the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù"
"91","NEGATIVE","As a personal opinion, I can leave the comment standing really - shaking head - standing. But a pasr points are too bad. Because these young people lack decency and behavior. No question. I myself experienced similar situations that were completely out of hand. To write about it: Right and important. Unfortunately, this behaviour in the German public is found in all German ‚Äútribes‚Äù and age groups. A topic that is painfully neglected...
 But to draw the above political and historical crosslinks and then to emphasize the skin color of the ‚Äúbellows‚Äù (other commentators have already pointed out why the emphasis here is crazy) leaves the text as terrible, to certain circles (the phous Weiszgerman population!) exaggeration. 
I wish the author soon rest and - cold showers equally - funny visits to the wild folk festivals of this republic.;) Maybe he can then approach the subject of ‚Äúpublic behaviour‚Äù a little more reflective..."
"92","POSITIVE","Good article, even if the usual AFD-ler here again foam. The ‚Äúbanality of evil‚Äù is a fact. But that's how man is, he won't change. And on the bottom line, the rather harmless figures described here pose less danger than the hump."
"93","NEGATIVE","What do you think about an article that writes about ‚Äúthe ugly Germans‚Äù, ‚Äúcitizen children‚Äù or ‚Äúwhite middle-class parents‚Äù? This is no better than what many AfD MEPs say. By the way, like ‚ÄúAFD-ler‚Äù. If you interfere with the statements of some people from this party, do not start copying them, or find it good if someone copies this undifferentiated language."
"94","POSITIVE","Very good article! Well observed, by no means overinterpreted (as some forists think here), courage to name uncomfortable truths. Just good journalism."
"95","NEGATIVE","The tenor of the article is completely overlapped. 
The author makes connections that I don't see. 
It's too much concern poetry for me."
"96","POSITIVE","Of course they want to provoke. Just like Lana del Rey with her Pussy song. They are tasteless, but harmless. Just like Lana del Rey with her Pussy song."
"97","POSITIVE","-I really ask me why he stressed that in the article? wants to show how cool and hip he is-

Oh, Lana del Rey is rather something for us middle-aged and therefore not cool automatically. I like her, too. She can't sing, but that makes her very beautiful."
"98","NEGATIVE","How was the author as a teenager? He never gave anything stupid, he still does? Has he ever been in a football stadium, has he ever written about the lyrics of Bushido and Co? Does he have prejudices against native young people? He lives in an ivory tower. Questions about questions"
"99","NEGATIVE","He took drugs and had a lot of sex, didn't you read the article thoroughly?"
"100","MIXED","Saying such things ‚Äúfor fun‚Äù has always been terrible. I have never understood why some people have so little sense that they find something so funny or just appropriate in any way."
"101","NEGATIVE","‚ÄúIn her posture lies the arrogance of a young white woman who knows that no matter what happens, her white middle-class parents will always somehow take her out.‚Äù

From this point on, it gets dubious. He's really going through his imagination. Football fans on the train are usually the plague, I know that too. But I've never developed these fantasies before."
"102","NEGATIVE","I am 2nd Generation Holocaust, with everything that belongs to it (which you certainly don't want to hear, because it's not beautiful, doesn't fit into your comfortable ‚ÄúI live today‚Äù image. And I will be ko.t.zubel with your comments. Born stupid, learned nothing, forget everything. I drive through D again with a cap and camouflage, because otherwise I'm not sure of my life, and you cheerfully roar from slicing, and then defend it. 
No, you obviously deserve the Merkel, with its open borders. Just so you can feel in your own body what a life has cost me to survive. 
so bad."
"103","NEGATIVE","I would be interested in who you are really afraid of and who you ‚Äúcamouflage‚Äù of? In front of the village youth, who in the rush roars songs about the opponents from the neighbouring village, but would never go to action, or in front of people who live out their attracted anti-Semitism quite soberly and openly here and, to my greatest regret, often can also."
"104","NEGATIVE","The center also scares me a lot, because it now dares to make racist statements again, once more people were more inhibited. In this respect, the Afdlers have already achieved something, the German Mitte may be ugly again, without fear of much contradiction."
"105","POSITIVE","About 6-7 years ago I experienced exactly such a scenario on a train ride from Khe-Durlach to Heilbronn. However, no football fans but already abundantly pre-annealed visitors to a disco in the hinterland (Bretten?). According to the names they called to each other probably children of Russia resettlers. But anyway, the AfD was still almost unknown at that time. But I'm glad you mention her."
"106","NEGATIVE","Oh, my goodness, Mr. Schwilden. No more dramaturgy was possible? It's presumptuous what you're doing here. I have just read the article in a well-groomed round of small and medium-sized enterprises and reaped headshakes and comments, which I do not want to continue here.

In the country, the watches often tick differently and yes, I do not like everything that distinguishes youth today. But how abusive you write here about the German, rural middle class and - like many of your left-wing colleagues - draw all the registers of inglorious German history - is cheap polemic.

Do you still expect young people to be ashamed of the German past every day? Have you never been young yourself, and have you ever done nonsense?

Your article is, with all due respect, a waste of time."
"107","POSITIVE","Full approval. Could not have put it better."
"108","NEUTRAL","Now let's imagine what would happen in this comment column if it were not Bio-Germans, but some people ‚Äúwith a southern appearance‚Äù who would have behaved exactly the same way.
Just think about it...;)"
"109","POSITIVE","I would like to thank all the district office employees of the savings bank staff and youth trainers, in general all those who hold this society together and, despite hostility, do not allow themselves to make Germany a little better."
"110","NEGATIVE","There are so days when you can't think of anything. Then you should not write an article, even if you have to. It's gonna be nothing."
"111","POSITIVE","You took up the conversation in an unpleasant situation, and you deserve respect for it. However, your article and the answers reveal a certain ‚Äúspeechlessness‚Äù because neither the young adults nor you understand (can/want) the other. In my opinion, parts of the group seem to be a little further. If you already ‚Äúcheck out‚Äù each other via social media, then you could continue to talk to each other and work on this deficit. It might help to break down prejudices. 
From this I recommend trips in the evenings with the various S-Bahn trains in the Ruhr area. Then you will meet other populations, which will make your first experience truly beautiful."
"112","NEGATIVE","Does this article actually fall under ‚Äúgroup-related hostility‚Äù? 

Oh, they were Germans? 

Well, then, of course, you can express yourself like that."
"113","NEGATIVE","At this point, thanks to the savings bank staff, the district office employees and the volunteer supervisors for children's football, who all do their job. At this point, I am ashamed of the arrogance of the author, who would like to check his self-exaggeration. It's sad that he doesn't even notice what cheap clich√©s he uses here."
"114","NEUTRAL","Frederic, would you have stayed with horticulture? üéº"
"115","POSITIVE","As the author draws the young people over here. Here people are written close to right-wing content. I advise the urban left-wing intellectual to increase the time from the high horse and to deal with the generation honestly."
"116","NEGATIVE","Just read in the news sticker of the WELT of a rioting man with 5 identities, who has become noticeable in a train between Hagen and Dortmund and has also injured several police officers. I do not hope that Mr Schwilden also witnessed this incident and tomorrow we will have to read an article on 'ugly Somalians'."
"117","NEUTRAL","Mr. Filden, if you like to train, then get off in Nuremberg and walk through the train station. And when you have Schneid, tell you truthfully what's going on."
"118","NEUTRAL","Nah, he should just as morally in between when women are treated badly. Oh, I forgot, they have to stay at home. Then he should say something when women #metoo are approached by the aforementioned station audience. Or mention that the rights of gay people and life must be respected. That would be interesting."
"119","NEGATIVE","a completely weak-minded commentary, clich√© and superfluous like a goiter, once again with the ancient Nazi club. Had I expected this more in time or in the mirror"
"120","NEUTRAL","Oh yes, the students of horticulture. I was allowed to teach. That's where the beer bottles were handed around. The biologists and psychologists who are also present (is a faculty) just pulled up their eyebrows. Probably something similar thought as you thought about the teenagers on the train."
"121","NEGATIVE","I haven't read such a seldom stupid article for a long time."
"122","POSITIVE","‚ÄúI wonder why nobody but me has a problem. ‚Äú

Because there's no problem. Except what you make of it. Anyone who thinks harsh drug use is less dangerous than girls' beer and cracked songs has a blast."
"123","NEUTRAL","I think he was thinking more of a peaceful bag and a normal girl..."
"124","NEGATIVE","What the author says and what he fears, I take seriously. However, I disagree with him on one important point. 

Like many others, I was against uncontrolled mass immigration from the outset, partly because I fear one thing: now living together is still working. But let us break in our prosperity, with high unemployment, etc. - a strong economic crisis is far from unlikely - then suddenly the situation looks quite different. Then the many foreigners, who are usually well identified externally, are suddenly hatred objects and 'free game' for guys who have no other behavior and want to react to people who in their eyes are just freakers. Hunt hunts would actually take place. 

However, I would not blame primarily for people like Bj√∂rn H√∂cke and his AfD, but for all the shunty and naive good people who seem to have no life experience and all those criminals who think they can simply reeducate a people in their own sense. Those who are reasonably wise and far-sighted must have such scenarios in mind. We have already acted deeply negligent and are still doing so by letting the borders rise wide."
"125","NEUTRAL","Have you ever thought about what happens when there's no money left for Hartz4? Then who pays for the maintenance of the non-working people?"
"126","NEUTRAL","Ever been to Primark? You'll be offered the same spectacle. However, from other populations. And not once, but 24 hours a day. 
But sorum, of course, it is not PC."
"127","MIXED","Actually, a nice story to think about. At the end then the reference to the AfD was unnecessary and also does not fit the article. The only thing missing is to turn the protagonists into AfD voters. As if it were a state requirement to mention the AfD at least once per article."
"128","NEGATIVE","I can also understand the article. In the criticism of the mention of AfD.. it is unfortunately the case that this parolengrolende (whatever) thing is very often attributable to a certain direction. The danger the author sees is that this is not the spiritual good, but the behavior. It is sometimes only a small step from that to the assumption of some senses."
"129","NEGATIVE","Absolutely lifted and unfair. Then take the S Bahn with large groups of migrants as fellow travellers."
"130","NEGATIVE","I can understand why one is piqued about such chants and such rough language. But when the passengers say ‚Äúyour pussies‚Äù, it's no less vulgar than when Lana del Rey sings the taste of her genital organs. It's just not ‚Äúavant-garde‚Äù. I don't like a writer or a passenger. And as a journalist for mixed things with the training ‚ÄúStudy of Horticulture at the Humboldt-Universit√§t‚Äù, one should perhaps comment a little more restrained. When I was the age of the author, I had my doctorate for years and next to it four children. Nevertheless, I would have encountered a different attitude towards similar people."
"131","POSITIVE","But the author did not write about Lana Del Rey or the general crash of light music - but about an experience in public life. His degree in horticulture obviously makes him no less receptive to rudeness in everyday life, which you really don't need a PhD. Since you have four children and a doctorate, I assume that you would stop your children in such a situation. And nice - you have to find the scenario also not at all costs."
"132","NEGATIVE","The article is hard to bear. What a line of nonsense."
"133","NEGATIVE","This is nothing new, that pubertizing 14 - 17 years are often verbal extremely reluctant to me: it is wondering whether the faces are already hardened, so that is internalized or not. If not, it's really just a game. Simple face is a small clear statement, but rather contemptuous, just as dentist assistant to tituate it, that is brutal even, young man! And by the way: for 100,000 years old people have been complaining about youth, that's not new either."
"134","POSITIVE","You're just a skewer, Mr. Schwilden! It's a typical German spit. Dachshund and hunter fence used to be. Today, spears look very different, but they think like you. No one asks me how to find dreadlocks that always mess so sour about wet sheep's wool. But congratulate you on leaving the bubble that you feel comfortable in. Even if you have to report about your condition afterwards..."
"135","NEGATIVE","So if you define a skewer according to that he does not like the rudeness, carelessness & funny (cunt) disrespect & wants the kids to put on a peaceful bag & quite normal girl, than ‚Äúbattle chants‚Äù - then I am really happy to be a skewer."
"136","NEGATIVE","Rarely read such an arrogous, self-righteous salvader."
