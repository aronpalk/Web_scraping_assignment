"1","NEGATIVE","I think it's like this:
For me, the top priority is, or my greatest concern is a timely and sufficient pension, 
Point
In second place is or is my safety important to me,
my personal as well as that of my belongings, point.
No satisfactory answer to my worries one and two, no voice from me.
It's not negotiable. 
Dot!"
"2","NEGATIVE","“... As the only party the Greens lose two percentage points to 19 percent in the week of their party day in Bielefeld...”. If we were to tell the reader where the 2% remained, I would be fully informed. However, interest in such surveys may not last longer than 24 hours."
"3","NEGATIVE","The bottom duck effect will soon faded out when people realize that they do not benefit from it."
"4","NEUTRAL","This grundrente is snoop guuut. Every politician wants that instead of his pension."
"5","NEUTRAL","“Groko” wants to support newspaper publishers massively and we taxpayers have to pay it!
Whose bread I eat whose song I sing.
In the future, publishers are expected to receive up to 645 million euros in government subsidies secretly, quietly and quietly. This also places them on the chain of state grants
- media distant from the state are being marginalized.

The influence of opinion continues to take its required course!"
"6","NEUTRAL","The CDU/CSU and the FDP could quickly push the AfD below 5% again. Buy yourself some reasonably reasonable AfD people - like the SPD with Otto Schily at the time. Potential candidates: e.g.: Meuthen, especially if he is overthrown by Höcke, Lucke would also be a candidate. Both the CDU/CSU and the FDP had already had a national-conservative or national-liberal wing - something like that is called the People's Party. Equal change of staff at the CDU/CSU to Merz and at the FDP to Graf von Lambsdorf."
"7","NEUTRAL","A few voters have been lured by the SPD. But the big end is still coming, because the taxpayers will bear the costs, and that's all of us. 

After all, the basic pension would not have required if the low-wage sector and temporary agency work had not been massively expanded under the leadership of the SPD. That's the real reason for the basic pension. 

Let's think about what the SPD is doing right now. 
1. The pension is increased for a part of the needy. 
2The low-wage sector continues to exist, even if it is the sg. minimum wage. 
3 people continue to work for little money and should get something in old age.
4 The retirement age will therefore continue to rise, otherwise the costs will rise too much.
5 The German Michel is asked to pay even more strongly. 

German politics consists only of eye-catching"
"8","NEGATIVE","“After the European elections they had climbed from 18 to 27 percent within a week”

Seems like some kind of Schulz effect. All of a sudden, one party shoots up in all polls - actually for no reason - without a reason. Which is then confirmed by no choice. And afterwards sackts then back together to the old value...

Neither Brandenburg nor Saxony let alone Thuringia has left only one percentage point in the election of what the Greens had allegedly increased from the European elections - including in the polls on the LTW.

What was still reasonably explainable in the SPD by the new “top candidate”, in which one quickly saw that it was only hot air, there is no rational explanation for this with the Greens."
"9","NEUTRAL","There's the explanation.
In the Bavarian election it was the Hambach Forest. Then Greta and F4F. In the first two Eastern elections, forest deforestation in the Amazon became the theme of the hour. 
The Greens use the media to focus on their topics shortly before elections. However, how seriously they take these things can be seen by how quickly these issues are forgotten."
"10","NEGATIVE","“Greens fall below 20 percent”
I'm very sorry about that now. Why do the Greens not resort to the time-tested means to turn the whole thing again? New taxes for all who vote wrongly/Surveys are banned/Higher levies on wrong voting behaviour."
"11","NEGATIVE","Every week new opinion polls with different values to find out who might be
just once in an election in two years, the chancellor - would like - to put.

And this with a plus/minus 2.5 percent error rate.

What a waste of money for simple party politics..

At the moment everything is clear we have 1 party with approx. 25-30 percent and 3 parties with potential
for 15-20 percent, then another 2 10's candidates.

Therefore, Groko- KleinKo is no longer mentioned, but only 3 covenants are mutually uneven
Participate are possible, whereby 2 are completely excluded.

Surveys therefore only help internally and should therefore only be carried out at large intervals
, so that day-to-day events do not become more and more questions of fate and the
Citizens sometimes have time to let something sag in terms of content."
"12","NEUTRAL","The whole discussion on the redistribution of money is like a dispute in the sandbox. If nothing is done in terms of educational politcs, there will soon be nothing to distribute. If Deutschlabd is to remain liveable, it is also important to invest heavily in terms of integration & penal enforcement, as well as in terms of care for the elderly and medical care. The better educated will not otherwise vote at the urn but with their feet. Sprinkle this sand in the eyes through politics and medisn must stop.
With regard to migration and integratuon, solutions have to be found, as long as nothing sustainable is done here, the Afd remains strong. It is not strong because the voters are evil people, because due politics disregards their concerns and the population is eating down."
"13","NEGATIVE","Looks like black-green-red!"
"14","NEUTRAL","Black-red-yellow would be too. Scholz will certainly be part of it, but the Greens will also go on the kecks with their miracle bag and populism. If the Greens make Annalena the top candidate, this coalition would be virtually inevitable. Well, I don't see the Greens yet. Habeck's Schulz effect (in the final phase) is already clearly recognizable. In the Bundestag elections, the Greens are again at < 10% - as in Fukushima. All they have to do is carry on with rental covers, expropriation, homeopathy, destruction of our industrial site, magical energy policy, farmer bashing, bashing car users, etc."
"15","NEUTRAL","How is it that pensions are higher in all comparable European countries? Who in Germany receives the surpluses of flattened pensions?"
"16","NEUTRAL","Who does: the numerous guests of course!"
"17","NEUTRAL","The SPD must urgently take care of where the jobs of the future are.
This issue is a core topic of the SPD together with the trade unions.
The salvation of the world climate can be left to the Greens."
"18","NEGATIVE","Jobs are not created by politicians, but by companies. Politics can only create the framework conditions to create incentives for new investments and jobs, but unfortunately, politics does exactly the opposite.

Rental covers, threats to expropriation, financial transaction tax, eternally expensive electricity and other energy, CO2 tax, increasingly absurd laws due to particulate matter and others, tax increases and other anti-economic mischief. 

The SPD is the completely wrong party. If then could only the CDU and FDP, but for this the CDU would have to finally return from their left thruck back to centre/right and that I see under Merkel or an AKK unfortunately in very far distance"
"19","NEUTRAL","If you don't get it slowly. Many major projects are made of SPD. Hartz made the labour market fit, and the minimum wage has brought many out of ramschlöhnen. 15 percent is too little. Million pensioners are now being better placed."
"20","NEGATIVE","So honestly, I find 15 percent far too much for the SPD!"
"21","NEUTRAL","If it helps the poor SPD, you can even put a couple of billions on state companies."
"22","NEUTRAL","41% trust at least one party not only to cause problems but also to solve them?
Well the idealists probably never die out; -)"
"23","NEUTRAL","Pension contributions (input) are very high in D and payouts are low.
In most countries, contributions for the future are calculated 30 years in advance.
to finance higher pensions. I see little air up there. Better management with revenue is essential for the future."
"24","NEUTRAL","Rudolf B.
Wrong approach.
It is not about the pension isolated, because a state budget is pay-as-you-go and the pensioners are not paid out what they once paid in.
We have a simple statement of income/expense, and we have too many costs on the expenditure side, which are also caused by people who do not pay or pay in, as well as exorbitantly high expenditure, for example, for diets and public servants, then you have to save on the weak, the pensioners. 

Just take a look at the pensions:
who pays how much 
who gets out how much.
The fake argument with too few children gets settled quite quickly.

Actually, it's a cheeky.
We pensioners should show what power the older generation still has. Pension should be the central issue for pensioners in a choice."
"25","NEGATIVE","I don't trust the basic pension. For me, this is the first step towards a single pension. Please do not misunderstand that I am giving less paid citizens a relatively carefree end of life. I just don't trust our government to do anything to benefit the people. I only hope that the result of the Greens will be right and will continue to decline rapidly."
"26","NEUTRAL","Do you think this basic pension comes at all?
So far, she doesn't have any,
wait for a while."
"27","NEUTRAL","With red-green, the SPD has lowered pensions, with black-red it returns something again. This is a trend in Germany - for decades. Fight the blacks and when you are in power, redistribute the money of companies and citizens."
"28","POSITIVE","I've always said that the cake is always 100%. It depends on how you distribute it to your friends."
"29","NEUTRAL","Every week I change my opinion which party I choose, sometimes the Greens, sometimes the Left, sometimes the CDU and sometimes the SPD are my voters.

Unfortunately, none of these opinion research institutes asks me about my opinion. You'd have to report new values every week."
"30","POSITIVE","I NEVER change my mind!

I live in Germany and have been German for generations.

I never change my mind on Germany."
"31","NEGATIVE","She will lose this 1 -2% in the next 4 weeks. Only in order to collect percentages, it has put even more pressure on the pension system, even if the money is to come from elsewhere.
It is an injustice without equal to people who have paid in 45 years and all this without means-testing, because what else is not. This SPD should disappear as soon as possible, it has done enough and the CDU is doing all this."
"32","NEUTRAL","@heike w: Did you remember that many people were only in need because the red-green government cut pensions? Isn't that unfair? And are there not many who do the same job or do more than others, but only half to one-third receive benefits - in proportion to the benefits for the others?"
"33","NEUTRAL","Mathematics tells us where it could go:

Left bearing: SPD GREEN LEFT 43%
GROKO PLUS: CDSU SPD FDP 50%
Theoretically: CDSU GREEN FDP 54%

Whether Merz does the experiment CDSU GREEN is unlikely.
So again GROKO now with PLUS. The FDP will be Merz better than the SPD with Scholz. And the SPD will rather bite into the sour apple Merz than go into the opposition.

What it could do for us?
We have two more years, “look, “Emperor Franz would say now."
"34","NEUTRAL","No, Miguel, the SPD will no longer coalise with the CDU. Then it would be final and for everyone downstairs. I never believe she does."
"35","NEGATIVE","The SPD has done a lot wrong - and still does a lot wrong. But it does not deserve one thing: to be replaced by the Greens, who, in a populist manner - what they always accuse their political opponents - capitalize on citizens' fears, with the promise of simple solutions to complex problems. So good news, when the green hype is now subside."
"36","NEUTRAL","But Ariadne, she deserves it. Just look at this politician like Maas, Scholz, etc. I hope it will be below 5% very soon. Then they can reposition their chancellor candidate."
"37","NEUTRAL","With bacon, you catch mice. The election gifts seem to arrive."
"38","NEGATIVE","@Lars R. That was not a bacon, but just a little return what was taken away under red-green."
"39","POSITIVE","I'm glad that the SPD gets better forecasts again."
"40","MIXED","That's what it was about. But the resuscitation will only take a short time..."
"41","NEUTRAL","“SPD benefits from basic pension”
Sorry, but for the basic pension you have to work at least 35 years, right?
I can't see that for the best sake of this party. Okay, actually, not at any party. No basic pension for the parties. 😁"
"42","NEUTRAL","So about 150 years?"
"43","NEUTRAL","Typically SPD. In a week, introduce a bit of basic pension and at the same time the CO2 increase in price. The bottom line is getting more expensive for the voter."
"44","NEGATIVE","Bemaba, according to WISO, already now goes from every euro over 49% to the state through direct and indirect road storage...
Means: As soon as climate tax madness takes place, more than 50% of every euro created is gone!
It's nice that the crap comes before the next big election, everyone can think about whether there's still money left for green politics..."
"45","NEUTRAL","SPD benefits from basic pension, greens fall below 20 percent

That the Greens lose, it's okay.
The SPD cannot win with your blackmailing policy either."
"46","NEGATIVE","Not so important - as long as the AFD continues to dump at 13 percent"
"47","NEUTRAL","The AfD has been dumbling at 13% for years, and as I know, the Greens have driven in Thuringia 22% for this. Anna-Greta-Habeck has already received congratulations from President Clinton."
"48","NEUTRAL","Comic statistics, despite the huge profits of AfD in Saxony, Thuringia and Brandenburg, the nationwide value should be stable. I don't think so."
"49","NEGATIVE","Saxony, Thuringia etc do not play a role, thanks to their number of inhabitants. Also, there are no gigantic gains for the AFD if you compare with the last Bundestag election/ The zenith has long been exceeded."
"50","MIXED","With the figures of the Greens it is evident that some of our fellow citizens now notice that it has been exaggerated with the topic “climate”... it is certainly important but it arouses in parts in a hysterical witch hunt without practical solutions, sense of reality and above all a social discussion because only a Opinion is true in ecological circles and in the media... Germany is and remains an industrial nation and the people here live on it even though it does not fit many in circles of the Greens... not everyone can live in Freiburg and lift a position in the university and think about how they manage to take away the jobs..."
"51","NEGATIVE","Why without practical solutions? It's now in the form of the CO2 tax. Everything went according to plan."
"52","NEGATIVE","Maybe some voters like me also got a habeckphobia? Against this omnipresence (dear world, only now when opening WO, Mr. Habeck looked at me three to four times) and also the content homage, one must almost be scared and reading my utility bills cannot calm me down."
"53","POSITIVE","Muaahhhhh. Oh, thank you. 😂"
"54","NEGATIVE","“As the only party, the Greens lose in the week of their party day...”
Did my fellow citizens also receive mail from the electricity supplier?"
"55","NEUTRAL","Yes, “we have to tell you... price level no longer to keep... EEG..”"
"56","NEGATIVE","That's going to last 14 days. Then the subject is forgotten and the percentages tumble back into the basement."
"57","NEGATIVE","But the money stays away permanently."
"58","NEUTRAL","N-TV Interpretation: Survey results hardly change...
Fortunately, the AFD has remained with persistence at the 13% for years.
Understand who wants, we don't."
"59","NEUTRAL","In the East the numbers are rising, in the decisive West less and less the AfD vote"
"60","NEGATIVE","Why is the pension not calculated Like that of the politician. Does not stand somewhere before the law all are equal?"
"61","NEUTRAL","Why politicians. It would be enough to calculate pensions like the pensions of officials. So after 40 years 71.75% of the last salary"
"62","NEUTRAL","The basic pension is the big litter!
OR?
“ONLY” about 53 years, a social security worker must pay into the pension fund if he gets exactly the average earnings to get on the pension equal to the minimum pension (5 civil servants years,1,700 euros, no means-test).
probably not the big litter!"
"63","NEGATIVE","Nobody prevented them from becoming an official, but now scold on it? I absolutely can't understand that."
"64","NEUTRAL","The SPD does not rise because of the basic pension, but in the bad and cold weather the Green voters do not switch to the CDU but to the SPD."
"65","NEUTRAL","The popularity of the Greens increases or falls under the spectre of “climate heating” proportional to the outside temperatures. In this respect, it is used in the 
go downhill next few months. To the values
of this party, one should prefer the weather frogs 
questioning."
"66","NEGATIVE","@Josef L: Hopefully it won't get that warm again next summer."
"67","NEUTRAL","The task of the governing parties is to put on the agenda the issues really fundamental for Germany rather than those with which one can quickly catch a few voices in self-generated needy people. The basic pension is a great example of this. It is a rejoiced new part of a completely outdated pension system and is going down with it if it is not fundamentally reestablished. It is also proof that the ridiculous financing base with income from a law that does not exist yet and that no one knows if and what it will look like is being coiled by the CDU, so that the SPD can score again for the preservation of the Posten-Groko, which is rejected by the majority of citizens."
"68","NEGATIVE","@Ralph R: See it athletic. Everything that was taken away from the citizens of 1998 - 2002, they now partially get back. And an outdated pension system? The system is already good, but the adjustments were not made peu à peu and not in time. This is the case when you need majorities and want to be in power. This is so since???"
"69","NEUTRAL","Now the SPD only has to abolish the unjust agenda 2010 and it's going to be something with the SPD?"
"70","NEUTRAL","With the #ungerechtenAgenda, the SPD laid the foundations for Germany's economic success."
"71","NEUTRAL","“SPD benefits from basic pension,” one must strongly doubt this, just a statistical fluctuation. ""Greens fall below 20 percent lose 2% “, well every drunk comes to an end then the “hangover”."
"72","NEUTRAL","Mrs Dreyer therefore describes a basic pension with 10% above the basic security, i.e. around €880, - as a socio-political milestone. If you had a pension after 35 years, you could have guided yourself to the minimum pension of €1.660, - after only 5 years of service"
"73","POSITIVE","I like to say it again and again. Nobody prevented them from becoming a civil servant. But in hindsight also get upset about that that can not be done at all."
"74","NEUTRAL","SPD benefits from basic pension! If she even comes! 
Where did the money come from? 
Pension insurance now relies on high federal subsidies!"
"75","NEUTRAL","Although it is called basic pension, it is not financed by pension insurance.
In contrast to the maternal pension, which is financed by pension insurance, to which certain groups of the population do not pay. 
I have two siblings: a national officer and a soldier. In the pension insurance, from which my parents' pension is financed, only I pay three children from us."
"76","NEUTRAL","Should the basic pension now hide the shouting injustice introduced by the SPD and the Greens with the H4 reforms?
How many employees have been kicked into the social side after some decades of having paid in the unemployment insurance scheme?"
"77","NEUTRAL","First introduce a large low-wage sector with the unjust Agenda 2010 and then try to fix something."
"78","NEGATIVE","These Bö (r) sen games.
Without any sense and mind, put the thermometer in somewhere and slipped around.

Politics as an opinion game."
"79","NEUTRAL","Wow a 15% percent party can charge all of Germany 50 billion in additional taxes and captivate half the economy.
I think we're about to end"
"80","NEUTRAL","Many media, education system, churches and trade unions, as well as the other left-wing parties are also on their side. In addition, not everything is bad about the climate pact, expansion of charging stations, for example, is good."
"81","NEUTRAL","What these survey evaluations are worth, we all experienced during the elections in Thuringiance,
Will you stop the theater?"
"82","NEUTRAL","True, no institute has seen The Left over 30%."
"83","NEUTRAL","Margaret Thatcher described the problem of the SPD policy as early as 1976.

“The problem of socialism is that at some point you run out of other people's money.”"
"84","NEUTRAL","The basic pension is undoubtedly a merit of the SPD. It remains to be hoped that the SPD will succeed in presenting this success to the public."
"85","NEGATIVE","@Jens B.
The voters will reward this. The SPD will crash even more. 
A basic pension as decided is a disaster."
"86","NEGATIVE","SPD benefits from basic pension until it disappears in the sink again. What kind of basic pension? Does the SPD mean the approved “fog candle”? You should pay the workers correctly, then you do not have to take such steps. Ridiculous."
"87","NEUTRAL","Tell the entrepreneurs, please.

After all, the SPD was able to counter something with the minimum wage."
"88","POSITIVE","You can also rewrite it like this:
Good news and bad news! The good thing is that the return of the Greens begins, the bad one is that the SPD is unfortunately getting more approval again. Apparently, those who confront the SPD in a benevolent way only count like the small one in primary school.
Please continue to calculate. It's not hard! This is Boomerang SPD promise. When the bow comes back, it hits violently."
"89","NEUTRAL","AfD again direction 4.9 percent"
"90","POSITIVE","I guess there's the wish, Father of thought.
The ghost is out of the bottle and can't be stopped anymore."
"91","NEGATIVE","No wonder: it's cold, cloudy and rainy. When temperatures rise above 30 degrees Celsius again next July, the poll values of the Greens will go up again. Alarmism is part of the political DNA of this party."
"92","NEGATIVE","In November it is cold and rainy. That doesn't change climate change, many voters think that the weather is not climate. Would at least be hoped"
"93","NEUTRAL","If the SPD were to set up an MP Woidke from Brandenburg as chancellor candidate who succeeded in getting Tesla, chances are increasing. But with people at the top like the two ladies who haven't even won a constituency, they won't score points"
"94","NEUTRAL","If the potential green voters realise the consequences of putting the Greens in the government or even the Federal Chancellor, the agreement would fall considerably further."
"95","NEUTRAL","I don't quite understand why the SPD or anyone else should benefit from it. 10 percent above the basic security only means that the pension supplement is now paid instead of the housing allowance. Unless you wouldn't have been accused of housing allowances because of too high assets. And for basic security recipients who fall out of the basic insurance due to the higher pension, other useful benefits are omitted. For example, social ticket, exemption from the GEZ. I'm curious to see who's the first thing to notice. Then the SPD will reduce again with its numbers."
"96","NEUTRAL","In a discussion it was explained that these useful benefits should NOT be eliminated due to the basic pension supplement! Thus there is no “COLD PROGRESSION” which still exists only in the case of tariff increases. Whether this is true is beyond my knowledge."
"97","NEUTRAL","How about the survey institutes always summarize the values of the SPD and the Greens? Then no movement would have to be reported."
"98","NEGATIVE","Even better would be if you summarize the left block!!"
"99","POSITIVE","I am looking forward to the upcoming CDU Party Congress and when the personal details for the chancellor candidature have been clarified. A lot depends on this. My guess is that with Merz as the CDU chancellor candidate, the AfD will slip off and the CDU will increase. Despite this, the Greens will probably continue to decline, just like the SPD. The FDP and the Left could enjoy a small upswing. Will still be very exciting. I am particularly interested in the non-voter block and how it behaves when campaign programs and personal data are fixed."
"100","NEUTRAL","Even if Merz were the chancellor candidate, it would not bring so much more votes. A swallow eight is far from a summer and so is it with Merz. Many personal data would have to be exchanged, which would then be used for ministerial posts, and the CDU would also have to make it very clear that it will not enter into a coalition with any of the RRG parties."
"101","NEGATIVE","The Bergmannschor will soon lose its charity. That means that the SPD succeeds in the turn. 

And for the basic pension, I'm not sure if it will last like that. Constitutionally, this law is extremely doubtful. Equal treatment is not possible. 

If someone has worked 34 years and 6 months now, what is it? And in the end, the 70€ more than the basic security that every Hartz4'ler gets, although he has never worked, what is there please nice with won. This will not be the major turning point in the poverty debate."
"102","NEGATIVE","“The big turnaround in the poverty debate will not be.” Yes, in the politician's fairy tales, only in reality just not."
"103","NEGATIVE","If the weather doesn't play along, the Greens will soon be back to the 10 percent of which they come from. Yes, I know it's actually about the climate, but the Greens themselves argued first and constantly with the hot weather in 2018."
"104","NEUTRAL","Whether the SPD can actually benefit from the basic pension will only be revealed in the medium term. Sometimes it takes until the voter dawns that social gifts have to be paid somehow."
"105","NEGATIVE","Because of the basic pension, the SPD rises by 2% points and now comes my question: when does a party take care of the pension of citizens who work for more than 35 years. This party would have to get 25% more immediately. Oh yes I forgot that no party would have to be touched by a hot iron. Completely incomprehensible the right way would have been at least 4% down."
"106","NEUTRAL","The AfD, for example, has quite rigorous plans for retirement."
"107","NEUTRAL","You have to reckon with people's forgetfulness. What the common voter in Oct. 2021 still knows about the successes of the SPD. That's just over two years. Until then, a lot can happen."
"108","NEUTRAL","When I see the SPD enjoying the basic pension and its candidacy, it reminds me of a dying person who once again goes to the sea."
"109","NEGATIVE","With this basic pension, millions of pensioners remain poor. As once again patchwork."
"110","NEUTRAL","Look at that! Proposal for the SPD: about 1 to 2 weeks before 24.10.2021 to launch a “Popping Law” and the dream of Scholz as the BK candidate of his party could become reality. 😎
No, seriously, this shouldn't go down:
“Forsa asked which party the Germans trust to “deal with the problems in Germany best”. 59 percent replied: none”
Also, if it's just a survey - this is very clear!"
"111","MIXED","NoName,
that's more than clear! But unfortunately also understandable."
"112","NEUTRAL","If now elections would be entirely different parties ahead!!!"
"113","NEUTRAL","Yes, the CDU still."
"114","POSITIVE","The SPD is back in the direction of its basic values with the basic pension. Well done!"
"115","POSITIVE","Good for who?"
"116","NEUTRAL","Because of the ridiculous basic pension two percentage points more? How strong can a party be that tackles the issue of pensions properly become?"
"117","NEUTRAL","Hi, I...
and then still a fair tax reform... not think at all how then the percentages would shoot up... but there is already over 30 years nothing done... ok you may dream.
greeting"
"118","NEUTRAL","With this gift from the CDU, the SPD can breathe again briefly and then go underwater again!"
"119","NEGATIVE","So whoever now returns to the SPD because of this “pseudo-basic pension law” is unfortunately no longer to help."
"120","NEUTRAL","In order to identify trends, I no longer need everyday opinion polls."
"121","NEGATIVE","How fast you can win a few points if you win something like the basic pension. I suppose this is due to those who will benefit now or in the very near future. But the next generation - which is likely to work for at least 15 years - will not have any of it. This funding will not be available long before, unfortunately I am sure."
"122","POSITIVE","Only a few benefit from this, the poverty of old age remains."
"123","NEUTRAL","Consider the quality of divelling rods; I would never tell the truth."
"124","NEGATIVE","Basic pension = cheat pack and fraud on voters/citizens."
"125","NEUTRAL","pinball.
close but apt!"
"126","NEUTRAL","In the polls of other opinion research institutes over the past two weeks, the Union ranged between 25 and 27 percent, the Greens between 18 and 22 percent, the SPD between 13 and 16 percent, the AfD between 14 and 15 percent...

The Greens are sinking and will fall behind the AfD at the federal level. I'm looking forward to it."
"127","POSITIVE","Let's keep our fingers crossed tightly!!"
"128","NEGATIVE","The percentages have been bought by the Sozen at the expense of future generations. Just disgusting."
"129","NEUTRAL","So the following I don't understand the green lands at 19 percent but only 10 percent trust them to have political competences?"
"130","NEGATIVE","One should not give much to such surveys."
"131","NEGATIVE","“As the only party, the Greens lose two percentage points to 19 percent in the week of their party day in Bielefeld”

Unfortunately, an analysis is lacking, which is why the GREEN alone lose their approval. 

It cannot be due to the massive election advertising for the Greens - even with an article about the statements made by the FDP general secretary today in the WELT - only Habeck jumps in the face - and no image or video commercial by Mrs. Teuteberg or the FDP. 

Do the citizens seem to realize that green politics only brings them extra taxes and bans - but personally does not benefit them in the bulk or receive their standard of living? 

The exceptions are, of course, the groups of clients benefiting from green policy (beneficiaries of green subsidies in the energy transition and financial profiteers in the refugee industry) whose financial burdens are to be borne by the Community of taxpayers. 

How prosperity is being developed and not just distributed, the citizens seem to have no or little competence to the GREEN in times of uncertainty. 

Nor does it help to write the right to an apartment in the Basic Law - is housing supposed to be redistributed socially according to need? Housing costs a lot of money - where should this come from, which the needy cannot finance housing construction or pay rent from their own income, to enable refinancing?"
"132","NEUTRAL","Correction of the last sentence:

Housing costs a lot of money - where should this come from if the needy cannot finance housing construction or pay rent from their own income to enable refinancing?"
"133","MIXED","Almost 60% believe the political parties are unable to solve the problems of our country. This speaks for itself and it should be incidental for the parties whether they lose or win in a recent survey in the context of statistical blur. It remains a testimony of poverty that the voters exhibits to the parties and their minds."
"134","NEGATIVE","“but since the end of June, the survey figures have been slowly but continuously downwards.”

Greta missing back and front:)"
"135","NEGATIVE","In any case, it cannot be due to lack of support from the media!"
"136","NEUTRAL","What are these perpetual surveys? The depth of these numbers is as rich in content as an empty bottle of Pommery."
"137","NEGATIVE","Free me for the SPD. Even if this is at the expense of the Greens. The main thing is that the AFD is now clear in fourth place and has been virtually unavailable for two years. East German elections back or forth. That's good."
"138","NEUTRAL","As the AfD stagnates nationwide, but in the East wins is clear - in the West, AfD voters become less."
"139","NEGATIVE","In all Waheln, the Greens are surprisingly far below the predictions and the AfD ha much more than said before. There are institutes that are particularly bad but are always quoted..."
"140","NEGATIVE","2% with a statistical fault tolerance: +/- 2.5 percentage points? That's dramatic."
"141","NEGATIVE","That is, the tolerance band slipped down by 2%. Oops"
"142","NEUTRAL","So the SPD buys 2% of the votes at the expense of taxpayers..."
"143","NEGATIVE","Yeah, that was to be expected. However, it is surprising that, on the other hand, no net contributors jump off the SPD train. Are there any more on board?"
"144","NEGATIVE","The Greens will lose much more approval by the next election, which is absolutely certain. Until then, the economic changes that are underway will turn the heads of many people."
"145","NEUTRAL","today received the announcement of the electricity price increase. - Thanks to green environmental policy."
"146","NEGATIVE","If 59% of all people surveyed no longer trust political solutions for Germany, no matter which party, then one must slowly wonder whether democracy fails... What is the point of being able to choose when the choice is always bad? A dangerous development..."
"147","NEUTRAL","If the SPD stays at its current course with Olaf Scholz, the CDU relies more on military operations than on diplomacy and the Greens prescribe compulsory measures for climate policy, the polls for the SPD will continue to rise."
"148","NEGATIVE","What should the Union benefit from?
I can't recognize my assets at the party by the best will. 
The “continued sleeper troupe” does not advance this country. Nor with this basic pension, which is not financed at all by."
"149","NEUTRAL","Ratzibur,
the CDU once had capable minds. But all of these were bitten away in time before they could reach higher offices. Incidentally, this also continues in many areas in the economy, in the public sector, in the media, in the sports associations, etc."
"150","NEGATIVE","Which party would now receive how many percent is irrelevant, since in terms of content only trace elements of distinctiveness are present.

Much more interesting almost 60% do not trust any party to solve the country's problems."
"151","POSITIVE","Well, if I want to have the exact values, I think it's more accurate when I die them out than I rely on some opinion institute."
"152","POSITIVE","They have been very well at all the last elections. Your dice too?"
"153","NEGATIVE","hopefully the Greens will be completely disenchanted by the next Bundestag election!"
"154","NEUTRAL","This has already been achieved in the last Bundestag election in 2017. Despite the poor result of the (former) People's Party SPD, the Greens reached only 8.9%. The left camp is structurally weaker than the bourgeois, which consists of AfD, CDU/CSU and FDP."
"155","NEUTRAL","Finally a recipe for success for the emerging SPD. Climate policy until it crashes - or the flood after us. How about a substantial increase in pension payments? Bring - if you sell it properly, loyalty payment - another few percent."
"156","NEGATIVE","Oh, yesterday R2G gaaanz just ahead of the government, today again far from it. BUT, as in all surveys over the past 2 years, clear majority for black/blue/yellow."
"157","NEUTRAL","George M
Black/blue/yellow will only not exist, not today, not tomorrow. Not even in the East, where the AFD is stronger, does that work."
"158","NEUTRAL","It has just been demonstrated in my lab that there is a positive correlation between snowfall boundary and greens approval values. An inverse correlation between fast-growing glaciers and polls of the greens can also be demonstrated. Should a continuous snow cover occur in Munich by mid-February, the case of the Greens can be predicted below 10%."
"159","NEUTRAL","Depending on the region, the snow line in the Alps is between 2,500 and 3,200 metres (summer). At these altitudes, snow is not uncommon in summer.... 
https://www.schneeradar.de/weblog/5756-wo-liegt-schnee-im-sommer/

A first approximation formula can be derived from this:
Poll values Green = (snow limit/100m +3)%
Example snow limit 2500m:
Poll values Green = (2500m/100m+3)% = 28%
The formula can be given even more precisely in the spring."
"160","POSITIVE","The good news with the article is that the AfD has stagnated at 13 percent in all German for years. And this despite the higher values in the East."
"161","POSITIVE","Personally, if I consider to be less good, you seem to be satisfied with our government."
"162","NEUTRAL","Unfortunately, we forget ALL very quickly. Anyone who voted CDU in the last Bundestag election (almost 33% against 21% SPD) can “be pleased” that he received 95% SPD program. Exaggerated - No. The SPD has been pushed through practically everything except the chancellor's armchair. Even the meantime unconstitutional SOLI is not gone after 1000 years of unification. In total, more than 50% will be levied. That 90% is no longer paying him, but only semantic statistics. However, the CDU promises that it will be completely abolished in the next legislature. I would rather hope for the Constitutional Court rather than for the Social Democratic market economists of the CDU. We should not be surprised at political discoursedness. I solemnly pledge improvement!"
"163","NEUTRAL","Agree with you. It must therefore be noted that a self-dismantling SPD can enforce more policy than the CDU. I'm curious to see how the CDU Party Congress is going out against this background."
