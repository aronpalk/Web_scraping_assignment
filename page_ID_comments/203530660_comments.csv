"1","MIXED","Too bad, very bad! I'm gonna miss this woman with your clear analytical thanks. How happy I watched your performances in talk shows, where it made so many established politicians look old."
"2","POSITIVE","A very authentic and readable interview!

'... the political debate is sick with the fact that much too much is thought of in the big city, because most politicians and journalists come from this MILIEU... ' 

This small excerpt from her interview - a seemingly inrelevant description of a condition... but Mrs Wagenknecht rightly describes this condition! Worth reading!"
"3","POSITIVE","Mrs Wagenknecht was never a “real political left”. She was and still is a politically clear thinking and acting woman who recognized, named and wanted to fight the evils of our time with humanist means.
It is precisely because of its objectivity, straightforwardness and humanity that it cannot be attributed to any political current and is respected by the politicians and voters of all political camps.
I hope to keep hearing from her."
"4","POSITIVE","I am definitely rather hard-conservative but I always found the Wagenknecht good, straightforward and with reasonable ideas.
I find a more social society and a competitive capitalist economy are no contradiction, and Mrs Wagenknecht has always advocated for this. I wish her all the best!"
"5","POSITIVE","One of the most capable politicians of today. A lot of depth in their conversations and analyses! An interview that stands out positively. Thank you for that!"
"6","NEUTRAL","The example should be followed by all the left. Graduate in dignity and realize that this garbage can no longer be seriously represented at 50. A disciple of the Saarland divider still sits in the cabinet and successfully takes care of the prestige of this formerly functioning community."
"7","POSITIVE","Thank you very much for this interview. I agree with Mrs Wagenknecht on almost all points. She is a human-minded, extremely clever and charming politician, unique in the Federal Republic. I will not forgive this party for the left to deal with it until the end of my life. I wish Mrs Wagenknecht that she can get a thicker skin, bearing in mind that reason and evil can oppose itself with greater force if the wrath goes to her hand. You should have the courage to find a new political home!"
"8","NEUTRAL","“The misconception that the market is doing everything has made Germany fall behind in technology.”

Germany is falling back because too much is being intervened in the market, because too many people are fed up and not ready to roll up their sleeves, and last but not least because the state is giving too much without demanding."
"9","POSITIVE","I very much appreciate Mrs Wagenknecht and her political attitude. She has always been an example for me as a woman. For her further life and her work for our society the best wishes of me."
"10","POSITIVE","To me a bit surprising that this handsome, intelligent, educated, etc. woman with her meaningful ideas of economy and society - certainly often driven by Oskar in the background - has no longer reached politically. The “left” was simply the wrong political label for them!"
"11","NEGATIVE","Too bad this woman leaves. You don't have to like ""The Left”, but Sarah Wagenknecht often gave good and very thoughtful contributions that would have been implemented if they had come from the former “People's Parties”!"
"12","POSITIVE","I never felt Sahra Wagenknecht cool, she didn't have to give herself impressing.
But she probably knows that, her heart and mind tells her. In this respect, it also radiates from the inside, 

What one carries in itself as a beauty (spiritual-soul-character) cannot be denied - and that also makes them enchanting. But she is also enchanting by her prudence, which has at least as much charm as the rest of this, even politically, special personality; -)!

Wish you a good time for new and vivous thoughts - to be able to participate from time to time?"
"13","POSITIVE","I am anything but a supporter of the SED/Left, but I have always respected Mrs Wagenknecht. It seems sincere, committed and lifelike."
"14","POSITIVE","It seems much more dissolved on the photos than the previous years. Nice for her to take this step - and touching as she speaks of her husband. 

I am rather conservative. But Sahra Wagenknecht liked and liked. Even their policies are surprisingly close to the ground."
"15","NEGATIVE","Na look, no shitstorm and only good wishes of people with different political views - but never inhuman. Other politicians can only dream of that!"
"16","POSITIVE","I'm politically from the other side! But a good politician, intelligent, authentic, punchy and very highly educated! Oskar is a lucky man!"
"17","POSITIVE","Yes, I know Sarah Wagenknecht mainly from talk shows. It actually embodies Robert Habeck's recipe for success even better: self-reflection, own thoughts instead of phrases, warm distance instead of ranschleim. And look good next to it. According to these criteria, she was actually still more convincing than Robert Habeck: Really original thoughts, really sharp analysis, no obvious stupidity and faux pas. Only if at the end of the analysis she sharply left - then she lost me. It remains with her confidence that even a leftist Germany would not be inhuman: a trust that I would not have with Kevin Kühnert, who, in my opinion, is more oriented towards Soviet officials. I will continue to listen carefully to her."
"18","NEUTRAL","Habeck has appropriated her ordoliberal thoughts. In fact, she should be elected as Chancellor, but with this party it is impossible."
"19","POSITIVE","Symphatic, smart answers! A nice interview"
"20","POSITIVE","I will always keep Sahra Wagenknecht's speech against the ESM in a positive memory. She is a very brave woman that she turned not only against Merkel, but also against her own party. Thank you very much for that!

What could this pearl of politician have been able to achieve everything in the right party! Unfortunately, she was on the road for the renamed SED."
"21","POSITIVE","Hat off from that woman! I bow deeply and wish for more people with these character traits. All the best and happiness for the future. “A business consultant”"
"22","MIXED","Dear Mrs. Wagenknecht, thank you very much for your interview replies. But your mind,
“... to fight for a fairer society in which there is more social cohesion, not just competition and selfishness,” nevertheless ignores the power of globalization. So far, this has been the everyday reality of all the corporate leaders and politicians of the last decades.


Not that I approve of them, but to rely on foreign markets as an export nation (ignoring the question of sustainability) calls for “having to shape politics with two souls”, which in turn should not mean exploiting children's souls and widowed women and mothers in emerging economies. are allowed.

Particularly passionate competitive thinking, in an ever harder global competition, ensures, in the event of success, only the economic prerequisites for the budgetary policy of all public bodies. This, first of all, only wonderful power, leads people to want and be able to create superhuman.

And in order to be able to cope with the greatest challenges of humanity in time, we need competition for the most qualified, sustainable and technically impressive solutions, precisely the competition of thought, research and compassion. A. d. Seek for ever more brilliant solutions to the creation (not in the c. and to project the most qualified educational offerings into the last corners of our globe. 

Equality, on the other hand, paralyzes, blinds and destroys people's most valuable (not aggressive) potentials. In addition, in the course of history, she always led to despotism, where she was prescribed by leadership clubs.
The freedom and strength you seek cannot be found in an equal existence without opposites and competition."
"23","POSITIVE","Basically, I can only agree with many commentators here. I am also not a voter of the left because the typical left is not Sarah Wagenknecht and vice versa. But I have great respect for Mrs Wagenknecht. She convincingly defends her conviction and fights for it. But factual, calm and thorough sound. I can't remember hearing them really loud or experiencing them differently when they were insulted. And I believe her almost unreservedly that she is really concerned with social justice and the people of Germany because, unlike Mr Schuster, I feel Mrs Wagenknecht as a woman with a lot of empathy, but it is also vulnerable. She shows empathy in the interview, for example, when it comes to dealing with the German Chancellor after her ztter attacks. Respect! Compassion for the media treatment of a political “opponent”. And that it really is about more justice, she says very aptly with this saying: “I think the political debate is sick with the fact that far too much is thought of in the big city, because most journalists and many politicians come from this milieu. From the refurbished old building in Berlin-Mitte you can confidently condemn the car or the oil heating. In rural areas or even in the small town life is different.” I could certainly choose a party that thinks this way and only has such clever members (very well in this interview also its statement on digitalisation and economic development in Germany). But the left is not such a party."
"24","POSITIVE","Although I am far from her party, I have always had respect for Mrs Wagenknecht. Her whole appearance is impressive: her intellect, her eloquence, she seems authentic and yes... her attractive appearance also works. Everything about her has style. That's why I was very sorry for her when that crackhead threw the cake in her face."
"25","NEGATIVE","Mrs. Wagenknecht is a highly honest and trustworthy person, unfortunately she was/is in the wrong party. Their views and suggestions are realistic and encouraging but wrong and contrasting with the views of the left.
I would like to have been able to keep her active, but understand that she's not doing that to herself."
"26","NEGATIVE","Mrs Wagenknecht is one of the few politicians who can also be appreciated if you do not share her beliefs. I think it would be a great loss for the political debate culture if it really should withdraw. The woman has charisma and, above all, a head of her own and cannot be dictated what she has to think or say. Not even from their party. There are only a few in the left spectrum. After all, left-wing politicians know that their own peer group is not exactly flexible when it comes to other perspectives. There's a traitor-in-the-thing accusation fast at hand. It's easier for the Conservatives. Probably because there is not really a solid world vision corset to be pushed into as a conservative. My respect, Mrs Wagenknecht. And that of one who is certainly not a leftist."
"27","POSITIVE","Competent, sympathetic, straightforward, human, has charisma and backbone.
Too bad she's retiring. I'm glad she thinks about her health.
Ales good for the future!"
"28","NEUTRAL","Quite a few conservatives, probably some from the middle range, regret the withdrawal of the most talented politician from the Berlin Bubble. With their realistic positions, many people in this country speak from their heart. Return not excluded."
"29","POSITIVE","Kuge and sympathetic woman. Although I do not share practically any of their political beliefs, I am glad that there are poltics like her or Gregor Gysi because they force you to think about one's own opinion. I wish her all the best."
"30","POSITIVE","Yes that's true"
"31","POSITIVE","A successful interview, I would have asked what she sees the most important differences between the Left Party and the SPD. 

Mrs Wagenknecht is straightforward and her answers make her sympathetic, she remains faithful to herself. Politics lose a talent and once again a representative of the old blow."
"32","NEUTRAL","👍👍👍👍👍"
"33","NEGATIVE","In the analysis of many current states, she is ahead of many politicians as a plaintext. No wonder because she doesn't live in one of the metropolitan inner cities that are increasingly disconnecting from life in the rest of the country.
Unfortunately, her conclusions derived from this are largely wrong... be it, she is already out of the shaping polituics anyway."
"34","POSITIVE","Not my party program, but an integral, authentic woman and politician. More of this in all parties of the spectrum and in the country would be better. 
All the best for the way forward."
"35","NEUTRAL","I hope that too"
"36","POSITIVE","Although I am not a supporter of the left, it is not difficult for me to say that I admire Sarah Wagenknecht's clear mind and clarity, even her beauty. It can quote the fist by heart. Wish her all the best."
"37","POSITIVE","Dealing intensively with a topic and making yourself competent in detail by reading and writing primary literature is a prominent feature of Fr. Wagenknecht. Although I largely do not share her political positions, she sees as a very serious, competent and respectable politician. To remain modest is impressed even more. The left should be careful not to lose her as an “inventive”."
"38","POSITIVE","Mrs Wagenknecht is pretty much the East German East German, whom I can only imagine (and that has nothing to do with the political orientation). That is probably the problem - or the consensus as you want: Actually, there should not be a real East at all, never! In a consistent way, Mrs Kiyak complains about too little integration measures taken by and through Mrs Wagenknecht. Well - she has always been something like the pointed stone in the shoe; that Mely Kiyak understands that, you can't demand from her either. In any case, I can still remember a very aggressive interview by Anne Will and her moderator in “Mal ehrlich”, which the two had with Mrs. Wagenknecht. That was quite forward-looking: Mrs. Will was rolled out the red carpet from now on (for the great integration of marginal groups) and Mrs. Wagenknecht, probably not humble enough for a marginal group, was constantly attacked. want to complete their career. Congratulations to the media, represented by Will&Co!"
"39","NEGATIVE","What distinguishes Mrs Wagenknecht is rarely found in politics today. She thinks Volksnah and addresses problems that are otherwise not addressed. Politicians such as Mrs. Wagenknecht are missing, but that is no wonder, because if you do not follow the ideological ideas of our current influenced policy, no one will last for a long time. I was hoping that “getting up” works, lots of just feasible ideas... a shame of a wonderful opportunity."
"40","POSITIVE","Even though I haven't always represented her line... a soothing interview with an interesting personality who has apparently found her personal center. Congratulations and respect!"
"41","NEUTRAL","@Michael B.:
Full approval.

Now, I hope that it will continue to publicize its fully comprehensible views and continue to show presence in the future, even if its public appearances will probably become less frequent due to the task of chairmen of the political groups. 

In some interviews (e.g. report from Berlin/Berlin directly) I wondered why moderators still conduct interviews, because many interlocutors seem to fluently download their rehearsed phrases, but do not answer the questions asked. With Sahra Wagenknecht as an interview partner this was pleasantly different, and her answers had substance. 

I wish Mrs Wagenknecht all the best for herself and your further political path."
