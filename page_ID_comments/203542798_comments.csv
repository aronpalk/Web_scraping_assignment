"1","NEUTRAL","Hard to bear, hard to bear. I hope the women can live a half-normal life again at some point."
"2","NEGATIVE","“How sick we are”

Well, I guess...
One can only hope that the court will not allow mitigating circumstances to apply because of this “disease”, but rather set an example and send the rulers behind bars for a long time.

As a woman, I know why I avoid certain corners of the city in the evenings...

Sad, but unfortunately true."
"3","NEGATIVE","The bad thing is that most of the women apparently went voluntarily with the men. Blue-eyed? So there is a lot to do in the education of young ladies..."
"4","NEGATIVE","Terrible attack on women's rights and sovereignty! Life will be destroyed here, because the affected women will never be the same again. German criminal law must be adapted immediately to the new circumstances! A society that allows such a thing has lost its right to exist. 
One gets the impression of protecting women does not matter in Germany. If this republic can't do that, then sometime a strong man will be cheered again to take it in his hands."
"5","NEUTRAL","Wa me personally “calms down” that due to the age of the perpetrators no juveniles law will be applied. The withdrawal of German citizenship in case of double citizenship would be an appropriate punishment for a long period of imprisonment.
The perpetrators can then “work off” the people of their producers.
As one of the perpetrators himself said, “How sick we are. “
From this I conclude that the perpetrators were absolutely sure of the offense relevance of their actions."
"6","NEUTRAL","@WELT thank you for mentioning your name and nationality. The word men cloaked in some crimes.
Politics and justice must agree locally, regionally and nationwide on other “customers” and probably new rules.

This requires open reporting."
"7","NEGATIVE","Very revealing: 55% of foreigners in group rapes, although foreigners in Germany account for only about 10% of the population. But it's always just “general suspicion” or an “individual case”. Much more decisive than the question of the German passport of the offender would be his religious affiliation. That would mean a much higher value than that 55%. But this probably falls under data protection."
"8","POSITIVE","Actually, I wanted to write your message. They were faster. Agree 100%."
"9","NEGATIVE","Speechless and infinitely angry."
"10","NEGATIVE","Speechless. What is the maximum penalty here?
54 percent of the perpetrators of foreign origin? What are the defendants, who obviously have a migration background but have German passport? To the Germans? What would the statistics look like if a migration background was still captured? The development since 2015?
Questions about questions from the mother of a daughter..."
"11","NEGATIVE","The statistics are not so easy, my daughter is also a child with a migrant background. Because her father is Swiss. Here in many articles but foreigners are not equal to foreigners. Careful! Believe only the statistics you forged yourself, it's not for nothing! And a correlation is far from causality! Just because there are more storks and more children in the country, the stork does not bring the babies!"
"12","POSITIVE","One cannot be grateful enough to the “world” for speaking plainly and courageously opposed the mainstream. My daily paper doesn't provide me with these facts. Please do not hesitate to keep your readers so well informed."
"13","NEUTRAL","“According to the Bundeskriminalamtes (BKA), rapes committed jointly are a “comparatively rare offence”.

1. The question arises here about the trend that is pointing upwards after my impressions.

2. If any group rape is too much, in my view it is a very despicable offense and I am entirely with the Spaniards, among whom a harsh verdict in a group rape (15 years) received much support (FAZ of 23.6.2019)."
"14","NEGATIVE","Not every immigrant is an enrichment to our culture. And yes, at 58% this comment is not xenophobia"
"15","NEUTRAL","Nidal E., Ahmed D., Amro L., Mehmed Y. and Taykan A., 25 to 29 years old, all born in Germany, three with German passport, two Turkish citizens.

It's not citizenship, it's the personal background, the milieu from which these men come. It's despised women. It is education, the basic attitude, probably also owed to a certain religion. 
As long as we do not manage to correct this attitude towards women in such people, something like this will happen again and again. However, the two Turks should be deported immediately after serving the sentence."
"16","NEGATIVE","And those with a German passport should, if possible, be deprived of citizenship. That can be done if they still have Turkish citizenship."
"17","NEGATIVE","Personally, I think that's the most degrading thing you can do to a human being. Acts that used to happen only in times of war."
"18","NEGATIVE","The Turks have practiced it methodically on the Cyprus invasion and still now very
extensive in Syria.
And no one, German or other European politicians with “Western values,” has not even lost a word of compassion.
Hypocritical world?"
"19","NEUTRAL","What punishments do such perpetrators have to expect? I very much hope that the highest possible punishment will be applied here. How can it be that relatives of the perpetrators behave like this in the courtroom and take cell phone recordings? Even if they were prevented from doing so, could they not have been expelled from the courtroom? When do we really begin to protect our young women from such acts and when is it possible to talk about certain cultural differences without being regarded as right-wing radical. And finally, I wonder how can a young woman who has experienced this can cope with it, there are assistance which, if necessary, extend over a longer period of time."
"20","NEUTRAL","<zit>The descriptions of the actions are so cruel that a spectator must leave the hall. <zit>

I can't imagine what the affected women must have been through. Can they ever get rid of what they've experienced again? Hopefully they get all the support, not only professional, but also from family and friends.

How can integration succeed if, on the one hand, one wants to approach people from other cultures without prejudice, but on the other hand, one should or must behave cautiously on the basis of such reports? In this case, even all the perpetrators were born and raised in Germany."
"21","NEUTRAL","“Among the 380 group rapes, the proportion of foreigners is 54.8 percent and is therefore relatively high.”

In the statistics of the suspects, in the PKS, each perpetrator is counted only once, even if he - as in the present case - was involved in several acts. 

The remaining 45.2 percent include not only ethnic Germans, but also immigrant perpetrators who have a German passport (including dual statesmen).

As regards the statistics, it should also be noted that they include only enlightened cases. So no unresolved cases and no darkfield. For perpetrators who stun their victims, the number of unresolved and unreported cases is quite high.

The proportion of foreigners in group rapes increased significantly from 2015 to 2016:
2015:41.3 percent
2016:67.8 percent

Residence status of 8,698 foreign sex offenders identified in 2016:
35 Military
51 students
62 Recognized Refugees
76 traders
131 Unauthorized stay
182 travelers
212 persons entitled to asylum
305 pupils
305 Patient
1004 employees
2831 Asylum seekers
3504 Other/not clarified"
"22","NEGATIVE","It's a pity that these figures, albeit publicly available, are not and will never be present in the media. How to deal with the situation if problems are not mentioned?"
