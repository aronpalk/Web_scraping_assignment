Schmidt once said that a state must never turn itself out to be blackmailable. At that time it was about the Landshut affair. Merkel has abandoned this principle of survival. Fatal."
"3","POSITIVE","If Mrs Merkel says that there is no danger, that will be true. With the saying “We create that” she was right!"
"4","NEGATIVE","Almost at the same time as a - fortunately thwarted - planned attack by Islamists/Salafists, Ms Merkel would like to tell me that there is no danger from just such...
This “logic” does not open up to me! 
Honestly, I'm seriously wondering what's going on in that woman's head in the meantime... “normal” doesn't seem to me anymore..."

"8","NEGATIVE","How was that at Miri? That's when the Bamf had forgotten something in his report. On 15.11.2019 Erdogan outsourced about 40,000 refugees from Istanbul to the province because they did not have a passport. Where do you think they're gonna end up without a passport, with a fake passport? First Seehofer wanted to prescribe a calming pill. The safety is supposedly not at risk!!! Even from the Mediterranean refugees, without passport, without proof Seehofer wants to guarantee security! I think Merkel's basement is already underwater! Mrs. Merkel wants to calm down? Nightingale... Erdogan certainly didn't mention any negative details about the deported. He'd be stupid. I wouldn't do that either. The details will only be found in the German courts within 2-5 years."
"9","NEGATIVE","Why does the Chancellor have to comment on this issue?

“Do not worry” than their mouth means: dear fellow citizens it threatens danger."
"10","NEUTRAL","When will the woman be held responsible for her assessments?

It's time we asked for accountability. Go through point by point how and whether the demands of the people have been fulfilled. After all, we are the people (even if I no longer live in Dt.), we work out the wealth and pay taxes (me too), we should determine who lives with us, who is allowed to enter the country."

"12","NEGATIVE","Merkel says. Merkel claims. I haven't believed a word spoken by this woman in a long time. Especially in this case not. How can you make such an uncredible and unproven assertion? “There's no danger”? Is she psychic? Or does it rely on the “reliable” German “security system” consisting of constitutional protection, BND, BKA and the Federal Prosecutor's Office? Sorry, but I'm getting laughing cramps due to the relevant experience of the last five years. Best example of the case Amri."
"13","NEGATIVE","It hurts me in my heart, because human rights must, of course, apply to everyone by definition, but my pragmatic-realistic side is saying more and more often: The Americans are doing this with Guantanamo! It is horrible to say this because such a prison undermines the principles of the rule of law and humanity. Nevertheless, I often have the impression that our judiciary, which is designed for reintegration into society, is failing due to the fanaticism of terrorists and the incomprehensiveness and complexity of what has happened in Syria. People who were somehow associated with ISIS sometimes prophylactically (instead of whining about the fact that they lived for years in the “Caliphate”, but there is no proof of membership in the US) and acknowledging that fanatics and extremists are hardly reintegrated into society because their ideological Brainwashing can hardly be completely undone, important first steps would be! Important for the protection of ordinary citizens! But who cares..."
"14","NEGATIVE","This is the reality of man. Not everything is colorful and peace joy-egg cake. In our modern and protected society bubble, many people lose the sense of danger and the actually chaotic nature of man. Dangerous people were formerly imprisoned or not let in a country! 
Not every person is good. And in order to protect the good, sometimes things have to be done that may not seem human in relation to an individual, but serve the security of the general public. Doing the right thing is not always the most moral value."
"15","MIXED","But of course, no need to worry, the German government has everything under control! That I'm not laughing! Several times the authorities have also officially admitted that they have neither the people nor the resources to monitor all the Islamist threats! Even if they now monitor these people well (to avoid a political scandal), that means that other Islamists have abandoned surveillance. In addition, this is not a purely German problem! I live in Austria. The whole EU is open to any terrorist who is not imprisoned. Unfortunately, we have not only the free movement of persons, but also the free movement of crime..."
"16","NEUTRAL","AM has long arrived in the political expiry date and still believes in its own political freshness that never existed. Germany is being smugled by its government with a prospect of decay. We have a government that the majority did not want, and the citizens have to endure everything they have to do with. What else does Mrs. Merkel want to smash??? That's still until 2021. Good night Germany."
"17","NEGATIVE","Dear Mrs. Merkel, one has never been able to give much to her word, her (un) actions have always spoken more than a thousand words. You have even increased your unreliability since 2015."

Then I'm completely reassured. She has always known exactly WHEN we citizens need to worry!"

"21","POSITIVE","Now they are there, we can do this, there is no reason to worry.M has long done..."
"22","NEGATIVE","The first sentence of Merkel:
There's no reason to worry!
It's not the end.
It is to be feared that after some time he will be supplemented by:
At that time, no one could expect it!
Yes!!
Very many will have been there who could expect it.
However, they have been disparaged and kept small."
"23","NEUTRAL","“No Gefshr” replaces “Wur do it. “ What's next?"
"24","NEGATIVE","Do you think Merkel knows how hated she is now? Nor do I believe that the polls should be the most popular politician. I don't know anyone who likes Merkel in my private and work environment. What she always! , when she does it, is always exactly the opposite of what I think is meaningful and good."
"25","NEUTRAL","I can only confirm! Many wish her all bad!"
"26","NEUTRAL","So if Mrs Merkel says that, then that must be true. Now I can sleep a lot better."
"27","NEUTRAL","Anyone who is surrounded by bodyguards and drives an armored limousine does not have to worry. That's right. But the ordinary citizen?"
"28","NEUTRAL","There is no cause for concern. For years, crime in Germany has declined.
Mrs Merkel is right, we live safely."
"29","NEUTRAL","Perhaps only the original population has changed their behavior and offers less attack surface."
"30","NEUTRAL","At the latest with this sentence, the alarm bells should shrill in the highest tones in a normal thinking person. 
What I've been waiting for since 2015 is:
When does the judiciary and executive intervene against the illegal machinations of the legislature?"
"31","NEGATIVE","Why do impossible things happen today, which frightens the population!
We are to replace the superficial slogans “we do it “with “we do away” or “no danger” with “highest danger and stupidity”!"
"32","NEUTRAL","I wasn't “frightened.” Don't know anyone else."
"33","NEUTRAL","If the Chancellor's words fall, I have a RED alert."
"34","NEGATIVE","Mrs Merkel has already secured a retirement residence in Paraguay for some time. This does not exactly speak for confidence in one's own policy of the future."

"40","NEUTRAL","This woman has long been no longer wearable as Chancellor. But 50% of Germans still want them.
I will not comment on the state of intelligence of the Germans. But the fact is that not everyone has the horizon. None at all."
"41","NEUTRAL","“Doesn't matter, we've always chosen them. I don't understand politics anyway.”
Either way, woolen!"
"42","NEGATIVE","I don't think I know that Merkel has been living in a parallel universe for a long time and has completely lost its relation to reality."
"43","NEGATIVE","And this is also pathological"
"44","NEUTRAL","No, of course not. And if you do, you can't change it big either. Because then they're just there."
"45","NEUTRAL","“No danger” says Merkel. In 2013 we heard about Pofalla in another matter (NSA): Don't panic, nobody is being monitored here — we have this in writing!”. He who believes will be blessed"
"46","NEGATIVE","There is a lot to learn from Mrs Merkel.
However, how not to do it.
Well, everyone has their methods."
"47","NEUTRAL","A REL majority of the electoral people advocates that AM should remain in office.
This madness of the Germans is hard to believe."

"49","NEGATIVE","The taxpayers are tired. The inner cities seem strange. The women live dangerously. A country where you like to live."
"50","POSITIVE","And “good”, you forgot “good”. Good and happy..."
"51","NEGATIVE","Just the fact that Mrs Merkel is going to the public with such unfounded promises — just one day after her government's grave misconduct on Amri has come to light, makes her seem like an empathious ice block. 
The Chancellor really does not seem to have any sense of what she might do with such unthoughtful statements to the survivors and injured."

"56","NEGATIVE","How can Mrs Merkel say such a thing, how can she assure that there is no danger from these people? 
After all, it is about ISIS supporters and in view of the many victims of violence, rape, murder carried out by the “skilled workers” who arrived, the lady has already been mighty mistaken. 
But she does not comment on that - after all, she does not do it - and continues to do so - we can do it.
These conditions are difficult to bear."

"62","NEUTRAL","But you already realize that the article is not about nuclear power plants?"
"63","NEUTRAL","“Accordingly, of course, it is ensured that there is no danger from these people” sounds like “We are creating this 2.0. “"

Is not a joke, but asked reality"
"74","NEUTRAL","I was wondering if we still had a Federal Chancellor. She has already become very quiet, unless she can give away German tax money abroad.
Well, and now she speaks again, she could have let her say..."

"78","NEGATIVE","Everybody standing next to it like little school boys and girls...
She dictates this country"
"79","NEUTRAL","No, I'm sure. 
Man, oh man, these are constructed truths."
"80","NEGATIVE","If Mrs Merkel says that there is no danger, it will be true because ea is no alternative!
However, the most disturbing thing is (once again) the fact that there is no contradiction from the CDU/CSU or from the other parties. What kind of pipes there in Berlin!"

"83","NEUTRAL","Had the DA (democratic departure) in which Merkel was active at the turn, not with the East CDU but with the SPD, Merkel would now be the SPD chairman. She never represented, like other politicians, the views and thinking of the CDU. For them, the CDU was only used to maintain power, giving up everything that this party once stood for."
"84","NEUTRAL","There should really be a term limit of 8 years so slowly. Just at Merkel you can see what kind of crap she built, after these years and last but not least, she only cares about her preservation of power. See the ministerial posts that the SPD (a then 20% party), see the basic pension (which was included in the coalition agreement!! Means-test), see Meuse the AKK snubled abroad and not a word about it by Merkel. One could write a book about what Merkel did after eight years Chancellor Germany and her party. However, I strongly doubt that she is in the CDU at all. You didn't see that once. She used it only to maintain power."
"85","NEUTRAL","@Heike, while the power of the CDU is crumbling in the last legislature, the basic pension for Mrs. Dr Merkel is probably not doing it!"
"86","NEUTRAL","“The Federal Chancellor assures that there is no reason to worry.” Of course, she does not have to worry. It is protected 24 hours a day. But what about the rest of the German population? Is Mrs. Merkel even worried about anything or is she already retired?"
"87","NEGATIVE","What I am most horrified: the absolute majority in this country chooses these conditions. Whether CDU/CSU, red, red, green, completely irrelevant.
And all this crap I'm going to finance with my taxes."
"88","NEUTRAL","As long as IS-close returnees can move freely through Germany, there is certainly a danger. But we can do this..."
"89","NEUTRAL","Of course, there is “no danger” according to our Chancellor's statement. Anyone who is as good as AM in the course of their personal protection can, of course, live without fear and move in public. I have considerable doubts that if their personal protection is removed, they are still anxious
could move. The fear of their own people and the misguided political decisions of the past and present can be seen from their faces. Too bad that the
population must bear the consequences, while it has long settled off."
"90","NEGATIVE","Who else believes that woman? Everything you have said and done so far has always been at the expense of the Dt. Citizen. It would be better if this woman finally withdrew from politics. The damage she did is no longer good."

To date, their decision in 2015 has not yet been reworked, unregistered asylum seekers are cashing the state and cashing at will, the deportations are a laugh number and now even larger calibers with zero inhibition threshold are coming to us. With the format of Seehofer with its appendix, we already know what is waiting for us.

"98","NEGATIVE","“Not everyone who has traveled to the territory of ISIS can also be prosecuted in Germany.”

.. yes, all paletti.. 
It's about money, too. This is getting scarce in Germany. 
In the long term taxes and tax increases are concerned by the taxpayer. Alimenting millions of people in the long run is a cause for great concern. Apart from the concern for safety and concreting for further housing and the destruction of the environment - in our Miniland - let alone. The country is getting smaller and everyone is fine.
The hospitals are closing in mass. Health examinations are available free of charge for refugees and migrants. All right.
Nothing will be more expensive: - (. Real estate tax will certainly be lowered, road expansion contributions will be abolished, interest will finally be paid again and the German toll for cars will finally be introduced; -)!!"

"102","NEGATIVE","There's no reason to leave Merkel in office for a day longer. Merkel and her opportunistic court, which is despised by Germany, must no longer bear government responsibility in our name!

Mondays for Germany!

Imagine that you earn 3,000 euros per month on a hard bone job in Germany.

Now you get the news that you can get 10,000 euros per month for doing nothing in Thailand. Just like that.

Maybe you'll have to impersonate yourself as Danes and throw away your ID card. Hundreds of thousands have already done this and report unison that it is true and works.

It is also not properly controlled, so you can pull this mesh several times and grab 40,000 or 50,000 euros per month.

In addition, you will receive a thankful welcome, get cuddly toys thrown at the head on your arrival and a bunch of friendly Thais will take care of you from now on.

The way to Thailand is troublesome and not entirely harmless, but if you make it, you have provided for the rest of your life.

It is clear that, in the face of such prospects and incentives, millions are making their way, even if they are not persecuted at all in their homeland.

Finally:
1. Germany is the country that pays by far the highest social benefits to immigrants.

2. Germany is the only country in the world where migrants get more than needy locals.

3. Germany is the only country whose citizens underestimate how much money migrants receive from their state.

Damage report end."
"114","POSITIVE","Axel G.@
Oh, thank you.
Worth reading and equally strange True."
"115","NEUTRAL","The human brain can't imagine much under a sum like 900 billion euros. 100 million, 50 billion, 900 billion. What does that mean? Anyone who hears such numbers usually understands only “a lot of money”. But how much exactly, this remains diffuse, mentally intangible.

As an illustration, there are 15 million net taxpayers in Germany. 900 million euros would be an average of 60 euros for everyone. 900 billion euros, on the other hand, represent a burden of 60,000 euros for everyone.

In addition, since 2015, more than 1.7 million asylum applications have been filed in Germany and currently just under 200,000 are on top of it every year.
https://bit.ly/2MQbd5U

Now everyone can briefly calculate how long they have to work to pay 60,000 euros of taxes and thus their share of the migration burden.

By the way, the fist formula always works when the government comes up with new projects: divide the costs by 15 million to understand how much an average net taxpayer has to sheet for it.

Thorsten Frei (CDU), vice-chairman of the European parliamentary group in the Bundestag, criticised the currently envisaged ceiling of 200,000 refugees per year as far too high. According to Frei (which I agree), Germany can handle a maximum of 50,000 to 75,000 asylum seekers per year.
https://bit.ly/32LIXH8

I often hear that migration has always existed. That's right. But the fact that millions of immigrants are being showered with such a galactic amount of money and social benefits that exceeds all imagination and over the long term priceless, has never existed anywhere in the history of mankind. You can have open borders or you can have a welfare state, but not both.
https://bit.ly/2Jp5bqO"
"116","NEUTRAL","However, most of the costs are not incurred at federal level, but at Länder and municipalities. Social assistance accounts for only part of the costs. There are also costs for administration, kindergartens and schools, a burden on the health system and the judicial system, language and integration courses and intensive care for young people. Public expenditure on refugees currently amounts to 50 billion euros in Germany (calculations by the Institute of German Economy and the Expert Council for assessing macroeconomic development) to 55 billion euros per year (Kiel Institute for Economic Research). The increasing demand for housing also exacerbates housing shortages and leads to further rising rents and real estate prices. This additional burden on tenants is significant, but difficult to quantify precisely, which is why it does not appear in statistics on refugee costs.
https://bit.ly/2NeMW8D
https://bit.ly/2pW4FJQ
https://bit.ly/2ojkk5C

As a large part of the refugee costs are stuck to cities and municipalities, many are now running out of money, despite the fact that the economy in Germany had gone well for 10 years.
https://bit.ly/2Jqsbpp

Raffelhüschen quotes the total burden of at least 450,000 euros incurred by the German state per average refugee during its lifetime. For 2 million refugees, this amounts to 900 billion euros. Sinn even considers this calculation to be too optimistic and assumes higher costs, since integration into the labour market will not succeed as quickly as hoped.

"117","NEUTRAL","A problem that countries with a less lush social system do not have: German low-income earners also pay only about a third of the health and care costs they incur. The remaining two thirds are taken over by other taxpayers and contributors through cross-subsidies. Most unqualified immigrants will therefore never support the German social system, but will also burden their lives when they work for a professional basis.

The same phenomenon is evident in Denmark: according to a study conducted in July 2019, almost 100% of all non-Western immigrants are a burden on public funds and will continue to be a burden for the rest of their lives. In addition to the Danes themselves, only immigrants from Western countries make a positive contribution to the social system.
https://bit.ly/343Ok4M

Studies on migration economics often show positive economic consequences (“migration dividend”). However, such international investigations are usually dominated by the experience of countries that either select their immigrants according to strict criteria or offer immigrants no social benefits, so that, on their own, the majority of people who are willing to benefit and are hungry for success (self-selection). The highly qualified, job-seeking Silicon-Valley immigrants are not comparable to those seeking care from the most education-distant strata, which Germany receives millions.

Compared to regular immigrants and refugees from previous decades, asylum seekers who arrived in Germany during the Merkel years have been much worse integrated into the labour market — despite a buzzing economy and a shortage of skilled workers.

It can be expected that a large proportion of people immigrated with asylum or refugee status since 2015 will receive social assistance throughout their lives and will never pursue a productive activity in Germany. How many people still manage to learn a relatively complicated new language in adulthood, then to make up for 5 years of lack of school education, then to complete a study or an apprenticeship and then to start their career?

Hoping that immigrants could provide a solution to the demographic problem and pay the pension of the ageing autochthonous German population, Hans-Werner Sinn and Bernd Raffelhüschen also explain: Even if refugees soon begin to pursue jobs corresponding to their qualifications, they will be able to The pension fund, as well as health and nursing funds, still receive significantly more benefits than they pay contributions."

According to information from the Berlin Institute for Population and Development, 13% of people who have come to Germany since 2015 as a refugee have never visited a school, 12% have only primary education, and more than 75% have no vocational training.

The already low level of education of immigrants to Germany for a long time seems to fall even further. Language level B1 is considered as a prerequisite for participation in the German labour market. While 23% of participants in literacy courses still reached B1 in August 2017, it was only 14% in August 2019.

In 2019, 46% of all ALG recipients are immigrants. The proportion of immigrants for working benefit recipients is even 57%. In 2013, these shares were still 36% and 43% respectively. While the number of unemployed Germans decreased by 43% between 2010 and 2018, the number of beneficiary immigrants in Germany has more than doubled since 2016.

As of 2019, which is now 4 years after the start of the large wave of refugees, 74.9% of all Syrians living in Germany are still living in Hartz IV.

“Thanks to studies by educational researchers such as Ludger Wößmann from the ifo Institute, reliable information on the qualifications and educational level of refugees is now available.

Unfortunately, there is a crushing picture: in Syria 65% of pupils do not make the leap over what the OECD defines as basic competencies (PISA Level I competence). In Albania, the quota is 59%. This means that two-thirds of the pupils in Syria can't read and write, or only very limited, and do not master the basic arithmetic methods. They must be considered functional illiterates and dyscalculates. These students will hardly be able to follow the lessons in Germany, even if they have learned German. In terms of learning material, Syrian eight-graders lag behind German pupils of the same age by 5 years. Most of them will probably never gain a foothold on the German labour market.

Gabriel Felbermayr and Michele Battisti (also ifo Institute) examined the refugees arriving in Turkish camps. There 46% of Syrians are below Pisa I level. So better than the average Syrian, but still a devastatingly poor level of education.

The formation of refugees from Afghanistan, Eritrea or Somalia is even worse than that of Syrians.

According to the Chamber of Crafts in Munich and Upper Bavaria, 70% of immigrants coming to Germany since 2016 from crisis countries who started training in Bavaria have now abandoned them again. For locals + former immigrants, the dropout rate is only 25%.
