"1","NEUTRAL","The example of the Berlin rowers shows very precisely what a proper solution can look like. As can be read in the article, a parallel structure that eliminates discrimination was created with which the association resources were shared and, if necessary, an association of the two structures was not ruled out in the future.

Of course, this is not 1to1 transferable to other clubs, precisely this is the point that such appropriate solutions can only be developed along real needs and structures, ideology alone cannot do this.

Of course, it is easy, like Mr Scholz, to portray something undifferentiated as no longer contemporary and survived in order to propagate one's own “progressivity”, since it is also unnecessary to determine whether there is a factual reason for such a forced change, i.e. at all prevented concrete persons from entering such clubs. , but only when this is the case, there is a need for action at all.

Just as few pensioners strive to join the Jusos and are discriminated against by the age limit, the crowd to most other such organisations will also be limited. 

Uniting from pure ideology to impose such costly and laborious changes in the statutes does not help anyone, even the image of Mr. Scholz as a fighter for equality.

Association statutes and their implementation can keep undesired members away even without explicit designation, forcing more than such a detour will not be possible in such a confrontational way.

The idea that the state has the key to solving all problems is a mistake, even if the SPD program should read the opposite."
"2","POSITIVE","Hooray, the financial cashier will be relieved. And let's face it, that's the only thing that matters."
"3","NEGATIVE","Who is not against discrimination?
It is bad enough that the same disciplines in sport are played by men and, moreover, women.
You could save a lot of time if you only had to watch one instead of two 100 sprints.
The same goes for football: why a womens""man""shank and additional a men""man""shank? Wanted not a mixed football “people” shaft?"
"4","NEUTRAL","Apart from the fact that association attitudes are not carved in stone, in Germany (and elsewhere) it will probably take the same period of time as since this biblical event before the “Zeitgeist” in the population most of such tax adjustments to the socio-cultural realities can affirm."
"5","NEUTRAL","It should be the other way around. The clubs become a massive problem for Scholz and the SPD. Someone really believes that people let themselves destroy their culturally formative traditions without resilient. With its steady left shift, the SPD is moving further and further away from its former voters."
"6","NEUTRAL","The next step towards the abolition of diversity and diversity. In doing so, “left” should advocate such a thing."
"7","MIXED","It's good that we don't have any more pressing problems, but the people must be engaged."
"8","NEUTRAL","Traditions can be shared, why not? Anyway, if the associations are to be co-financed by the state. That's what I expect as a taxpayer. If you don't want that, you should drink your beer privately. Drums, horseback riding, fishing can be men and women. In Germany, we are just at least 10 years behind the other EU Member States, 30 years behind the Americans, which is due to our 100-year-old association law and the German association history. They laugh at Germany: how are they in Germany? Even the bullfighters invited women to join. Of course there are mono-clubs elsewhere, but not state-funded, with the adventurous reason: We want to stay as we are and you should pay us. No, no."
"9","POSITIVE","Although I am not a member of such an association, I benefit greatly with my family because they organize events in the village, the St. Martin Train, the Carnival Train and the Fair, some of which have been for over 100 years. Of course, these are non-profit associations. I don't care what other countries do. I want our traditions to continue to be maintained."
"10","NEGATIVE","This is as unnecessary as a goiter, perhaps one should consider reducing the remuneration to Mr Scholz until something sensible is said again."
"11","NEUTRAL","In our weekly skate round, no women are allowed and are never allowed. Once a week three hours of fun without women's supervision I will not let myself take away and the charity can be..."
"12","NEUTRAL","And this skate club is subsidized as a non-profit association with all of us tax money? That would actually be awesome. Also in our village pub there are regular skate rounds. And the Skatbrüder simply pay for their own beer."
"13","NEUTRAL","What do I want as a woman in such a club? If I really want to shoot, there are other shooting clubs that take women. Their bad luck that there in many competitions then trophies go to clubs with women. If they're supposed to play alone, somehow belongs to freedom."
"14","NEGATIVE","The nice thing is, you don't even have to join the club. Only if a woman wants, why should she be forbidden? Replace the feature gender with skin color or with marital status. Should we then also finance associations that exclude Asian-outgoing people or unmarried men? Should everyone then form clubs according to their characteristics? Should we reinstate the fire service charge only for men, because it is only for men to serve in the fire department? That's what you're doing."
"15","NEUTRAL","Whether this would be implemented in the case of conservative Islamic mosque associations, as in the case of the German men's riders?"
"16","NEGATIVE","Guaranteed not! That would be a big screaming."
"17","NEGATIVE","I have been a member of the SPD for 43 years. I cannot vote for Mr Scholz because of the woman at his side, who shines with condescending sayings towards men. But I don't want to be a member of a feminist party. When do men finally develop a healthy self-confidence again? All the millions who work as a factory or clerk on a daily basis carry out their duties and take care of their families? 

No one needs to be insulted by these feminists as macho, old white man or potential violent perpetrators."
"18","NEGATIVE","I'm afraid they're in the wrong party by now. For this reason, I myself left the SPD after 21 years."
"19","NEUTRAL","But that is precisely the goal: to abolish all traditions, to dry out the humus of society and everything that points to history and origin and historically grown structures. An unoriented citizen is a well-managed citizen. The gender number is just the vehicle for the socialist prank."
"20","NEUTRAL","Traditions can be shared, however, if they are financed by the state. Drums, horseback riding, fishing can be men and women. In Germany, we are just at least 10 years behind the other EU Member States, 30 years behind the Americans, which is due to our 100-year-old association law and the history of the club. They laugh at Germany: how are they in Germany? Even the bullfighters invited women to join. Of course there are mono-clubs elsewhere, but not state-funded and look back."
"21","NEGATIVE","I believe Mr Scholz wants to prevent him from becoming Chancellor with all his power. A person can't think of that much crap on his own.
By the way, the charity of the Catholic Church, the largest men's association in history, should also be examined urgently..."
"22","NEUTRAL","Um... The Catholic Church, like all other recognized churches, has its own status outside the criteria of charity in tax law."
"23","NEGATIVE","Germany really has other worries. Top of the economy! This gender stuff gets a status he doesn't deem."
"24","NEUTRAL","Tell me."
"25","NEUTRAL","Every person is allowed to enter a pure human club.
but man is masculine, what do the human beings do?
Silly gendercramp!"
"26","NEGATIVE","Mr Scholz, you don't seem to care about traditions. Why don't you go one step further and question Christmas? Would have a wonderful alternative: how about the sugar festival?"
"27","NEGATIVE","Basically, all registered associations should be checked for their charity. To look at only pure “men domains” here is wrong."
"28","NEUTRAL","The tax office checks at all non-profit associations every three years in which non-profit is still granted."
"29","NEUTRAL","For me as a woman, this SPD club is unselectable, even if it is mixed."
"30","NEUTRAL","Perhaps, first of all, we should tackle the instigated inequality of treatment between men in the Basic Law. Before we take the Basic Law as a benchmark for equal treatment!

“Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany Art 12a”"
"31","NEUTRAL","It's a long time ago. For this you have to change nivht the GG."
"32","NEUTRAL","Should this also apply to purely women's associations? I already have some ideas where I would want to enter as a man."
"33","NEUTRAL","Jo, we have a women's sauna club. I doubt the ladies would be delighted if the men were to push for membership."
"34","NEUTRAL","Some people don't have a tradition."
"35","POSITIVE","The clubs have no problem, others have the problem!"
"36","NEUTRAL","I think it's right: why shouldn't a man engage in the interests of the country women or a woman for the men's choir? The ruling of the Bundesfinanzhof of 17 May 2017 is unambiguous. Tax benefits only if non-discriminatory access. Only the unfounded ban on women is inadmissible if you want to be a non-profit. Flexible performance formats ready. If threatened minority, then dismantling disadvantage, also ok. Most mono-sex clubs were created because it was a cultural or sporting encounter that followed the professions (workers' singing association, Bergmannschor, etc.) and women were not allowed to participate. Thus the male cathedral continued in cultural clubs and women had to open their own clubs. This has nothing to do with art. Are women now supposed to be excluded from military music again? Here is the report of the scientific service BT https://www.bundestag.de/.../8bf... /wd-4-069-17-pdf-data.pdfch believes it is right that the state should respect Art. 3.3 GG, even in its promotion. Gender separation only where mandatory."
"37","NEGATIVE","How nice. I just wrote to an old friend whose husband is in a “Bart Club”. And in fact, all members carry imposing beards there. She will encourage a renaming to “Bärt***innen” club. Sometimes reality is so absurd-funny, you can't think up. 😅"
"38","NEGATIVE","Here again something will be destroyed which has a centuries-old tradition. Why are only men's clubs affected by this? Why are women's associations excluded from this that do not want men in their ranks? Why does the principle of equality not apply here, because it is not the SPD that constantly ravages about equality. But there is a hope that the SPD will soon no longer be part of the government, since they are already on the right track."
"39","NEUTRAL","First read, then discuss. Of course, not only men's clubs are affected, but also women's clubs."
"40","NEGATIVE","Absolutely nonsensical what a Mr Scholz proposes, then women's clubs should also be affected in the same turn. Here just someone tries to make a profile again, you could also have future chancellor ambitions, gelle?"
"41","NEUTRAL","I expect a finance minister to implement decisions of the Federal Finance Court. What else?"
"42","NEUTRAL","Mr Scholz wants to become chancellor, and since women are now in Germany, Mr Scholz should look at the word “voice situation” from all sides and select suitable clinics."
"43","NEUTRAL","Do men have no rights at all?
No right to decide to want “under yourself”?
Do women have to push themselves into this, or men are forced to admit women, even if they are undesirable?
Are we men not allowed to decide for themselves?"
"44","NEGATIVE",", it is not forbidden to anyon. only should state institutions or state support be aligned with the Basic Law and state-sponsored associations do not exclude gender or religion or disability without reason. What if you exclude wheelchair accessible men from the singing club or born illegitimate. Would that be okay?"
"45","NEGATIVE","As Mr Kubicki said, this eternally laughing Mr Scholz has disqualified himself, not only for the Ministry of Finance, but also for any other office, and one can only agree that is my opinion on this."
"46","NEUTRAL","Even guilt who chooses this SPD still... oh yes... are yes yes not many anymore: -D"
"47","NEGATIVE","The “Lichtgestalt” Scholz with its permanent grin certainly wants to shoot against student corporations. Since there have been women's connections for years, I am curious to see if they also suffer from the lack of charity."
"48","NEUTRAL","Nah, the change only affects clubs that don't take women.

The clubs that do not accept men are not affected by this."
"49","NEUTRAL","Does our finance minister have no major concerns?"
"50","NEGATIVE","Only clubs should be non-profit, where at least one redhead, blonder and short-sighted are present."
"51","POSITIVE","Axel, are you against baldness? Protects the platelets!!! You and me, we have the same humor."
"52","NEGATIVE","One point bloated up and became zero...
The Dwarf of the SPD continues to progress."
"53","NEUTRAL","Well, there will probably be the Schützenverein and the Landfrauenbund
 “From the brains of Mr. Scholz” problems."
"54","NEGATIVE","I find it discriminatory that only women are spoken here at all times. In doing so, the theme of the various is completely hidden. There is an urgent need to be improved here."
"55","NEGATIVE","In Mr Scholz, mistakes are based on mistakes. Have we ever had such an inappropriate finance minister? When you look at your work in this way, you want GroKo to fall apart again."
"56","NEUTRAL","Who or what did Mr. Scholz have the air supremacy over his cot?"
"57","NEGATIVE","“You should not stick to anything, “just because it's been done like this for 150 years.”

The lady doesn't understand the Rhineland. And I don't have the words about Scholz's proposals. He just needs to profile himself, otherwise such ideas can not be understood."
"58","NEUTRAL","Another attack by the SPD on civil society."
"59","NEUTRAL","I don't know if it's Mr. Scholz's 'charity. ' Or is it more about state tax revenue menu? 

But I am full with Mr. Scholz, when only mixed men's football championships can be played, as well as mixed women's choirs can sing. 
Sovie “equality” must be in it for the common benefit.; -)"
"60","NEGATIVE","“The problem of traditional men's clubs”

In our society too much is being dismantled and you no longer have a look at the essentials.
I often have the impression that it is being decavated for the “disintegrating will”."
"61","NEGATIVE","So and again a new provincial posse. Instead of worrying about the real problems in the economy, you throw such unimportant issues into the ring. The problem in Germany is only the opinion makers and the politicians who follow up on everything. There's no one with a backward angle. It's time for a change, but the problem is that there's no one. Well, we can do it."
"62","NEUTRAL","But H. Scholz thought too short, there are not 100 genders now."
"63","NEUTRAL","Someone need money there 🤔"
"64","NEGATIVE","Yes, the real non-profit associations and their members with proper honorary offices (i.e. no superiors, generals, etc.) need money."
"65","POSITIVE","Vlt. you can also lay the often right handicraft by the side of the “bustling” lads.
By the way, Mr. Scholz also means pure women's associations!"
"66","NEGATIVE","The worst men's alliances are right-wing labourhoods. But has nothing to do with the subject of tax."
"67","NEUTRAL","Women and men have different psychology. There's no point in doing this the same, it doesn't work, it's against human psychology. 
Men behave differently when women are there - and therefore they don't want to have one with them and go to men's clubs. You're not going to a ladies' coffee party to talk about any women's issues. 
Well, anything against human psychology doesn't work anyway, so don't."
"68","NEUTRAL","Psychology is a science. And somebody who thinks they're familiar with it should at least know that."
"69","NEGATIVE","What's the problem? 
Simply include in the statutes that at the annual general meeting a woman must be a secretary and the quota is already fulfilled."
"70","MIXED","Alfred, what a chauvinist goat. Ungd is exactly what anyone can keep as he wants. But why should this medieval opinion be financed with taxpayers' money?"
"71","NEUTRAL","Worth reading is also the WORLD article “This verdict harms the German association culture” of 08.08.2017, which deals with the decision of the Bundesfinanzhof of 17.05.2017, to which the Federal Finance Minister reacted so quickly."
"72","POSITIVE","The SPD is working very successfully on its project u5!"
"73","NEUTRAL","The charity of an association is only about tax benefits. Taxes pay everyone, women and men. Many thousands of clubs in Germany are not recognized as non-profit. Those who want it and thus want to benefit from tax advantages of all taxpayers (men and women) should therefore also be open to all taxpayers (men and women). Scholz's demand is therefore not a “message”, but a matter of course. After all, we live in the 21st century."
"74","NEUTRAL","@ Lingers 
I see the same way.
Traditions can also be cultivated with women, we are in the 21st century, not in the 
Middle Ages, where women were only good to get “” ancestor “”!"
"75","NEGATIVE","So I find this tradition as ridiculous as the Scholz action."
"76","NEUTRAL","Wedding corsos are the new tradition?"
"77","NEUTRAL","After a few weeks, the SPD minister has probably forgotten the Thuringia election again. They just don't want to hear the warning shots in the SPD. But they'll hear it soon."
"78","NEUTRAL","Nonprofit is not what happens in the association, but what results from it as a positive impact for the general public. In a Schützrnverein, for example, the holding of a Schützenfest daz counts, since there not only members of the association participate, but also other persons.
That's why it doesn't matter if only men, only women or just others belong to the club."
"79","NEGATIVE","And the whole positive would have gone, if a woman is allowed to be in the club?"
"80","NEUTRAL","SPD can also be abolished"
"81","NEUTRAL","@ Torben N. This is what the SPD already does, only they do not notice it."
"82","POSITIVE","The sublime importance of this issue makes me truly awesome. What a great and monumental task of our time!

I very much hope that a solution will soon be found.

I suggest: ban ALL old clubs and establish new, colourful clubs. Fill this beautifully evenly with man, woman, man, woman, goldfish, fawn, woman, man, housefly, woman... etc. And please also note a completely uniform age! We don't want pensioners, mature people, young people, children and fetuses to feel reset.

And since the name and meaning of a club can also be discriminatory, all German clubs are called “Allgemeiner Verein, Mixed Gender, Mixed Gender and Mixed Aged Being with Alternating Tasks and Topics”."
"83","NEUTRAL","Is it necessary to wonder why it is not immediately determined that it cannot be a non-profit who excludes one or all but one population? After all, this would affect all religious associations, including Protestant and Catholic Church."
"84","NEGATIVE","If you want to distract from a catastrophic policy, you try to delight yourself in things and tell yourself that are simply aimed at ridiculous in the meantime."
"85","NEGATIVE","Far too high a discussion. Sympthomatic for today. Thousands of clubs have to fight for their charity (it's all about tax benefits) if they want to. A male singing association (which allows only men by statutes) would only have to change a single paragraph by a general meeting in order to retain the charity. And then the women would surely come into the men's singing groups in flocks. Or you just set up a female or mixed choir - because all of a sudden so many singing women are signing up."
"86","NEGATIVE","The speech was explicitly only of men's associations that do not accept women. Scholz explicitly did not say that it should also apply the other way around. It is not intended."
"87","NEGATIVE","Only this will not be in compliance with the law. No one is allowed to be disadvantaged because of his sex. The Federal Constitutional Court or, if applicable, the European Court of Human Rights would tear the air apart. Hrr Scholz knows that. Nat the election of the SPD party chairmen, one will not hear about it anymore."
"88","NEUTRAL","But there are also more like enough women's clubs, such as LadiesCircle, rural women, women's choirs, sisterhoods. Then they would have to let men too.
Or start with religions as only men as God's representatives, nuns, separate prayers"
"89","NEUTRAL","The Landfrauenverein in my region has been allowing men by statutes for years. They don't want to."
"90","NEUTRAL","associations are private activities that take place in the public space. The private person voluntarily commits himself to his interests during his free time. Can't the state at least leave the citizens alone here? Does he have to interfere with everything with his ideology? The sums that the state can save with this new proposal are marginal and totally uninteresting for the federal budget. So it's about patronization. What do you call a state that wants to control all areas of life (work, family, education, leisure, etc.)?"
"91","NEUTRAL","How about prostate self-help groups?"
"92","POSITIVE","AWESOME!"
"93","NEGATIVE","Why should I use my taxpayers' money to finance corporations that exclude me from the outset?"
"94","NEUTRAL","clubs do not receive tax money, they simply do not have to pay taxes, which would often be very low anyway."
"95","NEGATIVE","Moin,,,,, ,Scholzibubi.... first let a part of Hamburg put in rubble and ashes (G20) then take no responsibility,,,, quickly run away to Berlin,,,, continue to organize nonsense at the expense of taxpayers,,,, no such thing... neither in Hamburg nor Berlin,,,, away with the
Shower head......."
"96","NEGATIVE","Scholz shouldn't be buzzing on side scenes. But if it nevertheless comes to this (nothing is impossible here anymore), simply close the club. He has not yet gathered that chaos will come in because he cannot estimate what these clubs are doing for the general nature."
"97","NEGATIVE","The question cannot be who an association accepts as a member, but how it is committed to society. For example, if a Lions or Rotary club traditionally only has male members, all of whom donate diligently, but donate their donations to support primary school projects, hospitals, or climate protection, then that's what matters. Nonprofit means making a valuable contribution to society as a whole - this can be the preservation of cultural goods, sports promotion or whatever. It doesn't matter how the members of the association sit together. 
I think this is an unnecessary sham discussion in advance obedience to generate sympathy among potential electoral clientele. Just as nonsensical as the renaming of “Christmas” to “Bear Festival”, so as not to upset Muslim parents. So seen in an urban nursery. The Muslim parents, incidentally, laughed at this decision. No one had demanded that. Just as in this case certainly; -)"
"98","NEGATIVE","There are Rotary and Lions who still rule out women today? It's hard to imagine. Why should they also????"
"99","NEGATIVE","What problem do some actually have? What the hell is that, let men groups be among themselves and girls groups like that! How can you be so intolerant and want to tell others who they have to spend their free time with. Man takes care of the real problems."
"100","NEGATIVE","“How can you be so intolerant and want to tell others who they have to spend their free time with?”

This is not prescribed to anyone here. Only charity (hence tax benefits) is called into question. It goes like this to thousands of clubs that do not receive recognition of charity from the outset."
"101","NEGATIVE","Slowly shut up of this state!
Australia soon I'm here..."
"102","NEUTRAL","The benefit for the community, and not the structure of the association itself, should be decisive for the community.
And apparently, the mentioned pure men's associations have a considerable benefit.
Once again, as is so often the case, politically intervene in the private realm and the citizens are to be pulled out."
"103","NEUTRAL","“And apparently, the mentioned pure men's associations have a significant benefit.”

For a maximum of 50% of taxpayers, and that is exactly what the Bundesfinanzhof has determined and denied the general benefit."
"104","POSITIVE","Women are in a club where only women are allowed to be.
Men are in a club where only men can be.
For many years, clubs have been supported for good reasons. Part of this support is the exemption from VAT.
Everything is going well for a long time and with a wide range of government coalitions.
Then comes a Social Democrat who wants to become chairman of his party.
He's still a minister. The rest is written by the story itself..."
"105","POSITIVE","It's crazy that you still have to discuss something like this. But good, from me. So there are two options:
1. The clubs accept everyone without exception and have arrived here and now.
2. You leave it and waive the tax privilege. Honestly, you can tell everyone: we can't give you a donation receipt, but then just take 30% off what you wanted to donate and is good. 

If it's really so important that only men are members, then man takes variant 2, all slightly more reasonable variant 1
The West will survive it."
"106","NEGATIVE","It is about partly centuries-old traditions. Stupid. The donations also concern the tax deduction of the amounts. This then pays half the general public. 
That's how the pol. parties that self-tinkered.
For 100€ donation for this, I get 50€levied at the tax, so I actually pay only 50€.
The party will receive another 45€ for my gift.
That's how your own financing goes. 
Let the stupid traditional watch how they do that."
"107","NEUTRAL","In these clubs nobody chooses the SPD anyway."
"108","NEUTRAL","No one with a little bit of mind chooses the SPD."
"109","NEGATIVE","“According to Federal Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) 👀, associations that deny women membership for no valid reason will be deprived of charity in future. 
I do not see any difference from the Greens in the demands, greens, etc. What's going on up there? Are you betting who can best annoy the citizen?
Please, dear voters, finally devote this construct."
"110","NEUTRAL","According to Federal Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD), associations that deny women membership for no valid reason will be deprived of charity in future. Scholz announced that the law of charitable profits is currently being changed. “Anyone who excludes women should not have tax benefits and issue donation receipts,” he said. 

But then politicians who have gone too far from reality should not be in the government. And Mr Scholz has already sworn away from reality in Hamburg, almost refusing to do so."
"111","NEGATIVE","You heard it.
The SPD wants to abolish itself.
We should help her with that.
I read nothing else from Mr Scholz's wish.
It remains the last voter push!"
"112","POSITIVE","And again 2% less!"
"113","NEGATIVE","I find this very difficult, from my point of view. At that time we had (and certainly still today) (recording) rituals in which man does not want to have a woman. But that's part of it. In the village, the Dirndln also wanted to participate in the Maibaum-guarding and erect. They have now founded a dirndl club and the boys and dirndls alternate. You celebrate together but you also have your own events. But I am in favour of absolute equality. For example, I share parental leave with my wife, as she would also like to work. But Mr. Scholz does not dare to do choirs, perhaps because there are too many women's essay clubs? Just as women have the right to be among women (e.g. in the women's sauna, which I can understand), sometimes men may be among themselves. This is also part of equality and of a modern society. However, women must not be excluded in professions and politics"
"114","NEUTRAL","Right, I am also in favour of equality and a 50% women's quota in road and civil engineering."
"115","NEGATIVE","Exactly, in the new era tradition is no longer desired..."
"116","NEUTRAL","there are non-profit associations that have brought their own culture..."
"117","NEUTRAL","Why, as a taxpayer, do I have to co-finance any associations whose charity is that all members have the same sex?"
"118","NEUTRAL","You didn't get it either, did you?"
"119","NEGATIVE","As long as the Church not open to women is subsidized by nothing more in the future, absolutely nothing, I am in favour of it."
"120","NEUTRAL","The local Schützenverein, in which I worked on the board for 16 years, exists since 1716 and is a men's club. With statutes and charity. The association organizes the annual Schützenfest and is happy to support other needy clubs (table, nursing homes, etc.) with not insignificant sums. The association also strives to preserve the life of the village and its infrastructure worth living, and therefore offers many events a year for its citizens. Yes, our women are excluded from membership. But they have no interest in applying for membership. They have their own clubs (country women, Kolping, etc.) and are very engaged there. Everyone is satisfied, Mr. Scholz. Leave us alone, please!"
"121","NEGATIVE","Perhaps your donors have no interest in donation receipts and donate without counter-direction from the general public."
"122","NEUTRAL","Do such associations exist because it serves the maintenance of voluntary customs or only for the purpose of tax optimization for any donor?"
"123","NEGATIVE","clubs just need money and that has to come from somewhere."
"124","NEUTRAL","If it does not fit into the grippy formulation, one can only partially use a quote in the world.
Specifically, I refer to the paragraph on the Hamburger Harmonie, where the founding year 1789 refers to the French revolution so appropriately. With its motto, freedom and equality (at that time meant as before the law) smoothly let the third component fall under the table. Because fraternite (fraternity) does not fit in either the article or the gender movement of Mr Scholz."
"125","NEGATIVE","It's incredible what people here have to do with them.
Instead of getting up and telling the Scholz properly the opinion, you complain and watch how you get all this somehow bent. I can't believe it.
Man and man and man... in association = non-profit 
Man and woman and man... in association = non-profit.
How hostile to men is that?
But we should not be surprised at the SPD. It was said in their policy programme: “Whoever wants human society must overcome the male.”
That means a contrast between human and male. Now imagine the outcry that one would refer the same to colored, women, migrants. The outcry would be huge, but obviously not if it was against men, especially against old white people.
Charity is about serving the common good, there is nothing about man and man and woman and man."
"126","NEGATIVE","The SPD is looking for every, but also really every little bit of fat in which it can enter. You don't notice anything. And they can't read either. For example, election results. What do these people like Scholz think that one of the many former voters is interested in whether women can become members of such clubs? Nor do unisex toilets or gender research. Take care of our economy and ensure that as many professionals as possible can contribute to success! That used to be SPD!!!"
"127","NEUTRAL","Moooment, the SPD has never taken care of economic concerns, which has only supported the extended arm of trade unions, which for themselves and the large corporations (the prime example is corruption at Volkswagen) have cut out rich salaries and wages."
"128","NEUTRAL","Full pot on it to the German citizen who works, fills with all sorts of taxes the tax cashier, ours goes to the club to get a balance from everyday life, and then we continue again with the maloche.
But the main thing is that the takers do not have any conditions."
"129","POSITIVE","“taker”! Delicious! They should go to politics."
"130","NEUTRAL","Mr. Scholz seals the relegation of the SPD.
And that the AfD gets an inflow, no one has to wonder about it."
"131","NEUTRAL","Equal treatment also applies to equal things, not only to diverse ones. You could also deprive groups of charity because there are only straight ones in it. Or just members of a religion."
"132","NEUTRAL","hm, you get the “e.V.” as an association quite simply with youth work. Many of Berlin sailing clubs praise their unplanned youth work highly, only to be considered a registered association. Schuetzenclubs can't do that? So in the US, children are learning how to use weapons, a kind of youth work? Somehow the right of association in this point in D is simply transverse"
"133","NEGATIVE","So these are the big problems that overturn the SPD and do not let its most important people sleep at night. The only thing you can do is get to your head. The Reds will hopefully slip below the 10% limit in the next election."
"134","NEUTRAL","“So these are the big problems that the SPD is dealing with”

Every Federal Finance Minister should be interested in decisions taken by the Federal Finance Court."
"135","MIXED","What is really so hard to accept that women are women, men are men and both occasionally just want to stay among themselves?

And then politics must think about what it wants to promote or torpedo. But if so, then please consistently."
"136","NEUTRAL","Women may also stay with each other if they want (women's swimming, women's shelters,...). In men, of course, this is something else because... Equality and stuff."
"137","NEGATIVE","I find it extremely embarrassing for a federal finance minister to interfere with such an issue. Isn't there something of more national importance to take care of?"
"138","NEGATIVE","I am still speechless, as Scholz here - and you can't emphasize it enough - torpedo the associations that are already suffering from a decline in membership. Because one thing is clear: if he gets through this approach, it will also meet pure women's associations accordingly. Anything else would be a gross breach of all principles of equal treatment."
"139","NEUTRAL","Then what about the church? Although women are allowed to be members, they are not allowed to rise to higher posts. So, Minister, you're finally going to be honest. Or, is there humpted further in the interest of church tax"
"140","NEUTRAL","Presumably, a minister is looking for a task for his nearly 2,000 members of the Federal Ministry of Finance so that they can become 2,000 employees.
That's the only way I can explain the whole thing about the men's clubs."
"141","NEUTRAL","Public benefit is interpreted much further by the case-law than the Minister of Finance, who appears to be squinting on the approval of certain circles, pretends to be. It is a non-profit person who benefits even a part of society. Otherwise, for example, an association that operates a women's shelter could never be a non-profit because its charitable activity is limited to a tiny segment of society (1. Women who become second victims of crimes and 3. Ask the association for help).

You will hardly find a club that really could be of service to every single member of society, and perhaps not a single one to serve every single member of society."
"142","NEGATIVE","I think that Scholz's advance is purest populism.
Excluding only men's associations is in violation of the equality requirement.

What about the women's associations or the women's houses, which are also run as E.V.?
Can I, even if I'm a man, sue myself in a women's shelter, and if not, does it lose its charity?
Or our country women? The ones in the village are really ripping something. 
Even more interesting: if a mosque association excludes Christians, does he lose charity?
Questions about questions."
"143","NEGATIVE","He probably puts his party in distress, in times like this, one should have politicians of format, what we have is a scholarship."
