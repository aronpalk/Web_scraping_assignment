"1","MIXED","Actually, a sensible idea. Unfortunately, it is overlooked that a very large part comes without papers and therefore a return is almost impossible. How is it supposed to be handled?"
"2","NEUTRAL","Although this proposal sounds reasonable, there is probably neither a majority in the German government nor in the EU."
"3","NEGATIVE","Nothing will come out of it anyway.
All words and declarations of intent without a real chance of success.
Only top politicians can spend the lovely long day in this way..."
"4","NEUTRAL","And if the other states do not play along, then finally close the borders and indicate an end to goodness. 

I am sure that this communication will be understood by the rest of Europe.

There are people who understand only clear words and announcing the consequences that arise in case of non-observance. 

Not always play the good uncle. Our politicians are only obliged to Germany. 
No one else."
"5","NEUTRAL","The decisive statement: “If we don't make it right now, never.” 
So let's not assume it could work this time. 
Perhaps with a reformed EU (later, perhaps). Or even without the EU?"
"6","NEUTRAL","Migration gives our society an increasingly Arab-Islamic character. Migrants bring their own culture. Hardly anyone comes because he wants to integrate. So our society will be 
still drastically change. This change is somewhat slowed down by Seehofer's approach at best. It certainly won't stop her. More consistent action would be needed. Unfortunately, the EU is too weak for this. In addition, the left-wing camp obviously welcomes the transformation of our society."
"7","POSITIVE","Finally, an approach that points in the right direction. A good first step, please implement immediately!"
"8","NEUTRAL","Make plans whose chances of success are zero. The rest of Europe acknowledges the implementation of such plans with a loud laugh."
"9","POSITIVE","Of the other states.. this is logical... they are happy to lead everything on to us who have invited.. but also the other parties in the BT will laugh and block green quite surely and RR probably too."
"10","NEUTRAL","-Measures restricting freedom, if necessary, must ensure that the right to enter does not escape the pre-examination. - (World)
This is exactly what the migrants on the border in South-Hungary, which is so far demonized by the friends of total boundlessness. 

- Resistance of advocates of open borders will be violent. And on the other hand, supporters of a 'fortress Europe' are likely to be hard to convince of the quota distribution that has been strictly rejected so far. - (World)
The quota distribution will not come because confidence in the EU's political commission decreases from year to year, or the planned central state of Europe is becoming increasingly unfit. The euro as a core project gives greetings. He has already failed in his meaningfulness, he was the trap for I and GR. By the way, about 80% of the laws come from Brussels today in D. 

What Seehofer does is well meant. He can retire."
"11","NEUTRAL","Let's not bother ourselves. As long as Germany freely accepts migrants and attracts them with a generous social system, there is no need for the other European states to change the status quo. Waving through is just the simplest solution of all. I fear only when Germany threatens to close its national border, to reject migrants and to limit social benefits, only when the migrants are stranded in Italy, France or Spain in large numbers, only then will we seriously discuss a European solution."
"12","NEGATIVE","It's a shame. The post is only for subscribers. But without reading it, I think from Seehofers will come. Words, words and then nothing. 
What does he want to do if national borders are as permeable as the EU's external borders and are committed to UN migration trade? Germany (government) is not yet ready for less migration. Many millions are well planned in the EU."
"13","NEUTRAL","This article deals with a package of measures deemed necessary to combat uncontrolled migration. The difficulties of these package of measures have been identified and are identified.
The timing of political enforceability was optimistically judged to be “favourable”.
“If not now, then never”. So never (subjective).
So forget the article."
"14","NEGATIVE","'would already be “rejected directly at the external frontier”; in these cases, 'no entry into the EU'. '
Then people enter illegally."
"15","NEGATIVE","Master plan no....? I stopped counting. 
Are there any elections currently pending?"
"16","POSITIVE","So whoever still believes that this will succeed, I congratulate him on his naivety."
"17","MIXED","If you look at the enormous demographic development, then it will be clear that Europe will not be able to bear the burden of recognised asylum seekers in the coming decades, so it can only be a fortress Europe, the abolition of the right to asylum, but the recruitment of the urgently needed key workers as needed. to give it. All this will be a tough and brutal struggle because it will mean a radical break with the values of some. After fierce conflicts much more violent than we know them so far, this will also happen because the self-interest of the majority of the population will prevail over the values and morals of the “some”. My hope is that we will remain democracies and will not become dictatorships in the course of the development of a 'fortress Europe'. But there is nothing guaranteed, the more fierce the resistance will be to accept the factual, the higher the risk of authoritarian structures."
"18","MIXED","Unfortunately, gloomy, but unfortunately true, I completely agree with you!"
"19","NEGATIVE","... game over, for a long time... simply completely unbelievable Mr. S."
"20","NEGATIVE","Everything Horst announces is doomed to failure. So just forget the whole thing."
"21","NEUTRAL","... suppose it will be the same laugh number as his constitutional action, his upper limit or the immigration toll imposed by him!"
"22","POSITIVE","Warm air from the political announcement world champion. The reality arises from the graph. Resteuropa is brickling and laughing."
"23","NEGATIVE","Find the graphics shaking.
Germany cannot cope with this."
"24","NEUTRAL","@Andrea,
Europe cannot cope with this."
"25","NEUTRAL","Haha, they still did not realize that the other EU countries do not want a European solution at all, they are all too happy to wave their stranded economic refugees to Germany. The only thing you like to take away from the Germans EU far is our money."
"26","NEUTRAL","Unfortunately, it is so"
"27","NEUTRAL","Before the EU is convinced of the solution, it is possible to ensure that the persons and their descendants are excluded from the right to vote in DE.

It is only allowed to apply for nationality who has entered under controlled conditions and not - like these people - at their own request without prior registration. For the offspring, too, it must be clear that their status depends on that of the parents. Parents have to apply for citizenships for their children in the home."
"28","NEUTRAL","The only sensible asylum system consists in a rigorous isolation of the external borders! In Africa, the population will more than double by 2050, but how many millions can Europe cope with - 5? Ten? 50 or 100?"
"29","POSITIVE","Proposal for a solid 3-point programme
1 - forget the odds
2 - secures the EU's external borders, immediately and effectively.
³ - makes the deportations fast, real and not just on paper.

... or keep making it as harmless as before. AfD & Co will be delighted."
"30","NEUTRAL","With this advance at the latest, Horst Seehofer has put himself in position as chancellor candidate. With this strategic thinking and planning skill, no other politician can come up with at present. Hard times for Scholz and Habeck start!"
"31","NEUTRAL","I don't know.
On the one hand, yes. But the Union needs sufficient votes to do so.
But I don't know what's going to make me choose this party."
"32","NEUTRAL","Mr S. has achieved only one thing in his life. In 1997, a law amendment as Minister of Health. By changing the law, he gave the self-government back to the health insurance funds. At this time it is pure corporations and they will defend and retain their revenues with all the necessary means. Thanks for that..."
"33","NEUTRAL","It's okay, Horst...!"
"34","NEUTRAL","I keep my fingers crossed that Seehofer succeeds, hope dies last. If this madness doesn't stop, our country will break. It is important that the Greens expose themselves quickly enough so that the voters can see through them and vote for the new post-Merkel CDU. Only if the Greens are no longer in the Federal Council and certainly not in the government can Germany be saved."
"35","NEGATIVE","Mr Seehofer could have done all this long ago. But no, he still decided to drop. He often had the right thought, (only not among the boat migrants). I really can't take this seriously anymore."
"36","NEUTRAL","If Horst Seehofer had been made in autumn 2015, when he was still Bavarian Prime Minister, then now a lot would be different."
"37","NEUTRAL","Funny, why don't I believe him?"
"38","NEUTRAL","Quota? Forget about it. Greetings from Vienna, Budapest, Warsaw, Prague..."
"39","NEGATIVE","What I firmly believe is that in Europe, *no country wants to have a right of asylum that anyone in Germany has come up with. Basically, I am more than sure that everyone would like to have Orban on this subject, just for incomprehensible reasons."
"40","POSITIVE","The fact that Seehofer comes around the corner again with such a proposal is surprising alone.
It would be even more surprising if he could enforce this in the German government and then in Europe.
Mr Seehofer, if you can do that, I'll take back all the bad things I've ever thought about them and said about them. I'll never say more turnhofer and bed rugs, and you're the coolest interior minister ever since Kanther. May the Groko last for two more years for me.
On the other hand, in the next few days I expect a word of power from Mom that this is not so manageable, that is, disturbs harmony with the SPD."
"41","NEUTRAL","How many plans put forward by Germany would be this? One does not need a new asylum system, one would only have to adhere to the current laws and the problem would be solved. However, Mrs Merkel decided differently in 2015 and overturned this law. Since then, the chaos continues."
"42","NEGATIVE","Why can't he simply put applicable laws back into force in Germany?
Reject all asylum seekers at the border because our neighbouring states are safe.
Trace illegal entry again.
No provision without secure personal data - just as usual for ordinary citizens.
No legal assistance for persons without identity.

More than emergency care, no more bars and, above all, end the integration number.

Then a European solution will soon be found."
"43","NEGATIVE","“Already in a year the proposed system should be binding EU law” 

Holy simplicity! So Seehofer wants to “defend itself against immigration into German social systems to the last patron”: unite in diversity?! Haha...

With pardon, Minister: this is not a master's plan - this is a disaster plan: what Merkel's “Welt-Sozialamt Deutschland” is expensive, “Resteuropa” is only fair and cheap - and acts like a magnet on migrants.

“The dream of a united Europe has no prospect of being realized. You don't make an omelette out of hard eggs.”
Charles de Gaulle"
"44","NEGATIVE","First of all, this template comes five years later. Secondly, the “open borders” lobby in the CDU, SPD, the Left and the Green Party will unrecognizable Mr Seehofer's proposal. Thirdly, Mrs Merkel's choatic asylum policy has divided Europe to the detriment of the population of Germany and our neighbours; no one sees Germany as a model worthy of imitation here. Fourthly, politicians with a backbone were called for the enforcement of a European asylum right. I cannot see that in Mr Seehofer."
"45","NEUTRAL","Let's do it step by step. Germany starts on 01.12.2019. All migrants who have already registered in other countries and then arrived in Germany will receive a free ticket, a package for the return trip and 50, - Euro as a way allowance for the Toi and a station bockwurst. This is not inhuman and in some way it corresponds to the current legal situation.
After 01.12. the countries of the EU will be able to take care of further details."
"46","NEUTRAL","Unfortunately, it is only briefly addressed in the article: 

Most EU countries will not agree with Seehofer's amendment, which will result in more asylum-seekers/refugees who would otherwise have simply gone further to D.

As a very first step, an important magnet must be removed for moving to D:
benefits in kind instead of cash benefits, 
abolition of the status of toleration, 
extension of family reunion,
Claim to Hartz IV through simple time-flow
 etc.

Only when Seehofer presents national measures here will EU neighbours be motivated to participate in a Europe-wide modernisation of asylum procedures!"
"47","NEGATIVE","... as well as real border controls and rejections."
"48","NEGATIVE","Seehofer is already getting out of the Miri case - how does he want to do this? Never and ever."
"49","NEUTRAL","The party that makes these plans recognizably gets back many voters and former voters."
"50","NEUTRAL","Who has the right to asylum for what reason?
There are now so many names for every conceivable life situation that in my opinion the real grounds for asylum, war, religion, politics, sexuality no longer play any role.
There are toleration, the fiction certificate, subsidiary protection, refugee status, asylum recognition.
There are examples where the mother has been granted subsidiary protection status, her daughter born here in D was granted refugee status. One has the title for 2 years, the other for 3 years. The flood of paper and job creation measures in the authorities are unsafe.
The offices are not networked here in Germany and the EU, data is resumed every time you apply. It's a joke, the whole asylum system. Asylum law and criminal law do not touch each other, so they can do what they want. Examples of this are available every day.
They fall into the Hartz 4 system after 15 months of stay and that's the jackpot for everyone. That's why everyone wants to go to D. And only that way. Not because of the weather, food, culture, our way of life, our rules.
We get excited about “Biodeutsche” Hartz 4 recipients, don't deal with them and catch up with others. 
The industry/business cries for skilled workers and burdens the costs of integrating the general public.
The whole EU is a disputed bunch in which everyone cooks their own soup.
If I were one of the “others”, I'd send everyone to D. without exception.
When I read what brews up on the Bosnia border, see the pity reports and above all from which countries and who comes, I get sky-scared.
None of the reporters asks, what do you want in D, how do you imagine your life, what do you know about the country, what is your education, can you read and write, who should be responsible for you, etc."
"51","POSITIVE","You are absolutely right about everything, but I am not only afraid of those who are still coming, but also of some individuals who have been here since 2015 and who knows what to plan"
"52","MIXED","Declarations of intent and suggestions were enough, but now also carry out times without letting any migration utopians spit into the soup each time. The proposed measures are actually an absolute matter of course, so do not just talk, then it will work again with the voters."
"53","NEUTRAL","Are the observations consistent with the EU's motion for a resolution on the fundamental rights of people of African descent in Europe?"
"54","NEGATIVE","“will be distributed among all EU states” Everyone with just a little bit of grips knows that this will never work. The main thing is to create another bureaucratic EU monster. Moreover, the EU border is so holey, so it does not actually deserve this designation. Another political fog candle without sense and mind."
"55","NEGATIVE","Well, at least. He's doing something and trying. 
Let's see who's gonna fail this again."
"56","NEGATIVE","Something should have been done long ago, now it's too late. Or do we know who is already under us???"
"57","NEGATIVE","If you had to pay taxes for hot air, the Seehofer would already be at risk of poverty. He is and remains an arcedeltheorist."
"58","NEUTRAL","Does our Interior Minister want to be able to say he tried? This allows him to spend more months of his “successful” term of office. Mercy!"
"59","NEUTRAL","Who should present a plan to Mr. Seehofer and what? Is there a problem?"
"60","NEUTRAL","Why is it a “force act” to take people who are taken up at or near the German external borders in Germany and say the word “asylum” “to secure the refusal on a judicial order in custody (reject detention)” because “there is a reasonable suspicion that the stay does not serve the stated purpose” (Aufenbhalktsgesetz) Paragraph 15), because they come “from a Member State of the European Communities or from another third country... which ensures the application of the Convention on the Status of Refugees and the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms” (Basic Law Article 16a paragraph 2)?
The Interior Minister would only have to instruct the competent authorities to act consistently in accordance with the law and to equip them with the necessary resources."
"61","NEGATIVE","If I only read the keyword “Seehofer proposes, stimulates, demands etc... I lie down again."
"62","NEGATIVE","“Before that, the whole thing would have to become the line of the federal government” - the decisive sentence.
That will never be the case in this BR, the paper will be faster off the table than the author can count to 3, bet..."
"63","NEGATIVE","It does not correspond to the line of the AM Folger and, unfortunately, in the meantime, probably no longer that of Mr. Söder, CSU... he also has been following the merchellinie since recently."
"64","NEUTRAL","“Make net chat”..."
"65","NEGATIVE","The comparison with a punk band is very oblique. Europe as a punk band? Disposed punk band? Bad metaphor. Maybe put good reporters on such a topic?"
"66","NEUTRAL","According to the graph, the number of refugees in the EU is recognised in need of protection. Is there also a graph of the rest of the population, such as the rejected, the patient, etc.?"
"67","NEGATIVE","@Wolfgang W. That would certainly be interesting but too many people unsettle, since the number for Germany would probably grow to 3 times. So you'd rather leave that"
"68","NEGATIVE","It won't be."
"69","NEUTRAL","Other EU countries do not comply with the Dublin procedure, but we stick to the open borders after Schengen."
"70","POSITIVE","And again the “European solution”
This has worked great since 2015."
"71","NEUTRAL","As long as we are in the EU, a European solution is the only option for me, since we have committed ourselves to open borders in the Schengen area at the same time."
"72","NEUTRAL","“The Ministry of the Interior has drawn up a plan that would bring Europe a new asylum system. Already in a year, it could be applicable law. “

Shall we laugh now? The “European solution” in a year? That's a burner! Certainly, Poland, Hungary etc have already agreed. I believe in Santa Claus or the completion of a “space station”."
"73","NEUTRAL","The article stated that at least some countries would participate in the distribution and that the rest would contribute to the border management and costs."
"74","NEUTRAL","So far, repatriations usually fail due to the lack of identity, lack of participation in the procurement of passport replacement and resistance. Why should these problems be solved more easily than by Germany directly at the EU's external border?"
"75","POSITIVE","According to the information, the measure was justified."
"76","NEUTRAL","If the refugee camps in Central Europe are similar to those in Southern Europe, no one will move on. I have never understood why 4-6 states around the world overwhelm the “vulnerable” with social money, while the rest of the world just tolerates them."
"77","NEGATIVE","With our chancellor and the red-green parties it doesn't work anyway and as usual big sayings first and then nothing happens and the next hiobses' messages reach us.
With current politicians, you can only put options."
"78","NEGATIVE","The highest price for this is not even a financial, as high as it is, but the poisoning of social coexistence through dishonesty, which is “necessary” in order to argumentatively “justify” the chosen path or to assert the sovereignty of discourse. The concealment, cover-up, omitting, redefining, exclusion, etc., is no longer ending. And the citizens, who have to observe, experience and suffer all this madness, are in the long run at the risk of becoming “insane”.
And at this point it has once again its full right to use the Schiller quote..."
"79","POSITIVE","Rarely good summary."
"80","NEUTRAL","If internal border controls have to be eliminated and the control of external borders is defined but not implemented as a basic prerequisite for this, if, instead of protecting the external borders against pure (poverty) migration, the transfer and transfer of people 'delivered' by tugs takes place de facto instead of protecting the external borders against pure (poverty) migration, the EU permanently — sometimes more, sometimes less — let the reins be taken out of the hand by self-proclaimed “sea rescue” and NGOs who defend migrants against “inhuman” measures if the states from which people flee/emigrate refuse to take back “unjustified “asylum seekers is not much sharper. and IF it is not finally absolutely clear between asylum and pure migration, and the following consequences are realized: , THE PROBLEMS WILL CONTINUE UNTIL THE EU HAS CHANGED SO THAT IT IS NO LONGER A “WORTHWHILE” DESTINATION FOR MIGRANTS.

Germany's policy has created the special problem that it has set itself the goal of integrating (almost) all those who have arrived here, i.e. wanting to keep here permanently. Without questioning the people, bypassing the basic asylum laws, disregarding all financial, social and cultural consequences.

(to be continued)"
"81","NEGATIVE","But why without questioning the people? The people were interviewed at BT in 2017 and 87 percent want to have this development. Or do I see that wrong? 
The phenomenon is that 87% of the German population accept this development in order not to elect a right-wing party on the other hand. This side location is most important. No one has to complain about that."
"82","NEUTRAL","Quote (Schiller): This is the curse of evil deed, that she must always bear evil. 

I vary this sentence so that it can be applied perfectly to the completely proceeding situation in the said area:
This is the curse of RESPECIAL, that they must always bear evil. 

At European level:
States will not be sanctioned if they
- do not adhere to the Dublin Agreements, 
- simply let migrants through (Flixbuses from Milan and Verona towards Germany), wave through, sometimes even help them to travel to more attractive countries,
- despite EU financial support, continually fail to comply with minimum standards for initial care and temporary accommodation of migrants (Greece),
- argue with false, i.e. excessive numbers of migrants (Italy)
- officially propagate a “generous” reception policy, but secretly tighten the conditions so that immigrants will have the incentive to continue migrating (Spain).
But the truth is that already years ago, countries like Spain and Italy, lying on the periphery of the EU and naturally the first to be affected, were too little supported, because the countries not immediately affected have taken a lean foothold; not only, but also that is why the selfishness of the states of which the vast majority mainly try to impose the “problem” as much as possible on others. This also applies — clearly — from a financial point of view. France is a 'very special actor' here.

The underlying problems, however, are these:
(to be continued)"
"83","NEGATIVE","The whole article is not comprehensible. Here asylum seekers and migrants are mixed up. Everyone knows that they are mostly economic migrants (people without a passport). Anyone applying for asylum should at least be able to prove with a passport which he is in danger in his country of origin.
As long as it is not realistically (truthfully) determined who these people are, everything will remain as it is. Pure chaos!!!"
"84","NEUTRAL","The liberal European right to asylum for the whole world must be abolished. When the right to asylum was decided at that time, we had a completely different situation. It was about people from the Eastern Bloc who were really politically persecuted. Today, people from distant countries come to Europe by well-organized mafia bands because they hope for a better life here. As an example, one should take Australia. But to do this, it requires courage and decisive action. Cooperation Union/AFD could bring a decisive step forward in this area"
"85","POSITIVE","Thanks to Horst Seehofer! At least a politician in Europe who takes care of our future with smart ideas. Unfortunately, not many politicians are so reasonable. Hopefully he can prevail!"
"86","NEGATIVE","Richard, the times when I put hope in Mr Seehofer are unfortunately over."
"87","MIXED","As usual with Seehofer, this plan, like its previous one, becomes a laugh number. He started to end the “rule of injustice”, he ended up as a willing executor of Merkel's welcome policy. Probably, the asylum farce around Lebanese clan leader Miri led to a new attack of actionist alibi policy in order to conceal his total failure to date, such as: borders are still open like a barn gate and thus the influx continues unchanged, the slingers are in high economic activity, the deportations stagnate and are even declining, social systems are being plundered - and this is supported by its direct 25% guarantee. Swaggling and fake activities are contradictory, as he accustomed to.
This government in the people of Merkel and Seehofer would have to be removed from their offices because of the damage caused to the detriment of the citizens and because of breach of law."
"88","POSITIVE","Hard and clear words, so is the reality, there is nothing to shade."
"89","NEUTRAL","“If we don't make it now, we'll never make it,” an official said his hope, “... what official was that? Does he not want to be named by name? Relotius will probably say hi here. Otherwise an informative article"
"90","NEUTRAL","Nix Relotius, Mr S., do not want to be called alone formants and interlocutors. Sincerely, ML"
"91","NEUTRAL","These are correct and long-due measures to control migration. However, it would also have to be taken into account which EU countries have so far received a large number of migrants, not in the sense that these countries are being burdened even more by taking family ties into account, but rather in the sense of relief, e.g. through “zero rounds” in the first distributions. But we all know who such plans will fail in Germany alone: among other things, the Greens, who are still the second strongest party in the polls. In this respect, it must be noted that there is no change at all and that the need for change in this country is not seen. It is also democracy to acknowledge this."
"92","NEUTRAL","If one is stakt in polls then one can use the laws with certain? This is the first time I hear."
"93","NEUTRAL","If his planning is not supported, he cannot be accused of simply not doing enough to find a solution to the problem!"
"94","NEUTRAL","Economic power and population? Oh, I suppose 75% will have to be included in Germany. The other Member States will be very satisfied!"
"95","NEGATIVE","Seehofer will not prevail; first, his own chancellor will fall in his back. The sad thing is, it's the last chance to do something. If black and green is in power in the next Bundestag election, you don't have to dream of a restrictive border policy."
"96","NEGATIVE","That's how it is. I'm sorry."
"97","NEGATIVE","In order for this plan to have a chance at all, Germany must immediately show a different behaviour. Reduction of services, control of national borders and consequent rejection of passengers from safe third countries.
As long as it is so comfortable for all other countries to simply wave through all migrants (i.e. travel to D), these countries have no pain in agreeing to any changes.
However, this consequence requires determination and hardness (i.v.mi. unsightly images). Therefore, this will not happen and the entire project will fail"
"98","NEGATIVE","That sounds pragmatic. But how should a preliminary check take place at the border if the migrants do not have papers? 
It is impossible!!"
"99","NEGATIVE","The lack of documents or assistance in clarifying the origin of the application is equivalent to rejecting the application. What's impossible about that?"
"100","NEUTRAL","Creating law in Europe has always been not a good counselor."
"101","POSITIVE","So I have the solution. It's simple. All people who illegally deport it immediately, if necessary, to an island. Then each country is allowed to choose for itself how many refugees, under which criteria they would like to accept legally. It's easy."
"102","NEUTRAL","Which island were you thinking about? Greenland?"
"103","NEUTRAL","There is no need to be a prophet to predict that this plan will never be implemented in the EU. At most, a handful of countries will participate, but this will bring almost nothing to Germany. The key points are the high social benefits and the extremely low deportation rate in Germany - as long as nothing changes, everything will remain as it is, that is, Germany remains the country that accommodates most asylum seekers - in the long term."
"104","NEUTRAL","“However, transfers to the competent states work as rarely as the deportations of rejected asylum seekers to their countries of origin. “

Well, it can't work without border controls."
"105","NEGATIVE","Oh, Germany is already making politics for Europe?
What a presumption.
Germany's asylum policy is a very bad export hit, no one wants it."

"108","MIXED","All this reads well and, of course, would be extremely useful, but who, after the bad experiences of recent years, seriously believes that this will become reality. A first necessity would be an immediate and consistent end to the unhindered entry into our country, and this has never been said to have been wanted. Why should countries suddenly submit themselves to a quota that has so far been vehemently opposed? Even the withdrawal of England from the EU, which is largely due to the eagerness of some members to migrate, has made this EU happen. Our IM has lost all credibility for me after its fundamental change of mind this year, unfortunately."
"109","POSITIVE","What we have not heard from Mr Seehofer: good sayings and nothing behind it!"
"110","NEUTRAL","First of all, thank you for this factual article, which also highlights the risks and resistance to a new EU asylum right.

Unfortunately, this plan will already fail nationally due to GREEN and SPD resistance and will be reduced to a minimum consensus: 

There will be no effective deportations of the mass of unauthorised migrants, nor will there be an examination of the application before entering the EU in centres with a residence obligation.

Only the obligatory quota for the admission of migrants by Germany will remain - but nothing is won at all - the mass of migrants want to enjoy the high German social benefits anyway."
"111","NEUTRAL","“The Ministry of the Interior has drawn up a plan”
If you have no persuasion or determination, you have a plan that will never become a reality. But that's how you save yourself through the legislature. Does S. seriously think he could make a difference with it, except dilatory until the end of the legislature? Where does he see the majorities (except for himself)"
"112","NEGATIVE","The UNHCR/Eurostat infographic in the article with the huge yellow circle in the middle shows very clearly the overall dilemma. Is no one willing and able to put an end to this madness?"
"113","NEUTRAL","At least those who go to the election are obviously not ready."
"114","NEGATIVE","These, admittedly, good ideas already fail here in Germany due to green and red. So they won't make it into the European Parliament. If this almost impossible happens and a strategy paper would end up in Brussels, which deserves the name, then that would end because most states do not trust Germany. The only viable solution will be to switch to benefits in kind throughout the EU. Because the incentive of the cash that can be sent to the home country falls away."
"115","POSITIVE","I am also in favour of benefits in kind, but let us imagine that the many migrants in Germany would switch from cash benefits to only benefits in kind, then it would finally be over with our security. Good night Germany!"

However, I fear that it will only be welcomed in a few countries:
Germany and Luxembourg!"
"118","NEUTRAL","After Dublin II was effectively leveraged by A.M. himself and alone (past parliament) and led the EU into chaos and quarrels. And so far, the other “attractive” northern destination countries have already closed down. How much will the motivation of the southern and eastern countries now be to install a new asylum procedure and help Germany with less coming to Germany? I would say the motivation will be somewhere at 0."

"128","NEGATIVE","Would be nice if it worked. I alone lack faith."
