"1","NEUTRAL","This is in a democracy so that majorities decide and not minorities or marginal groups"
"2","NEGATIVE","Oh, man, in this article it has to dawn even the last green voters that their eco-association tries to drive us at full throttle (from me also in a dizzy electric car) against the wall..."
"3","NEUTRAL","“We want 80 euros,” explained the delegates from Lake Constance.”

I offer 300, who offers more. It's like at the greens fair."
"4","NEUTRAL","That's funny: First in Germany, the main drivers to abolish nuclear power and then want to buy nuclear power from abroad on a large scale. That Habeck & Co. does not have a plan should become clear to the last one."
"5","NEGATIVE","But you put a lot of trust in your fellow human beings... I don't think the Green voters realize what they're doing"
"6","NEUTRAL","“At the end of the party day, Claudia Roth pitched the lectern to point out the consequences of climate change, including the “immeasurable loss of home”. 30 million people have already been displaced by environmental crises, said the Vice President of the Bundestag. 
...
It is not about bringing all these people to Europe, Roth assured. But the request it promoted and approved by the delegates states that climate change could “create situations that correspond to persecution within the meaning of the Geneva Convention — and thus establish international asylum law”.

Request adopted by the delegates. What does that have to do with the CSF? And something like that just goes through...

But anyway, we do not want to have this discussion here.

Only one thing is certain: if one day there are large numbers of extraterrestrials on this planet and ask for admission - the Vice President of the Bundestag will certainly welcome them all. Well, in two years she may not be in the Bundestag anymore, but we will surely hear a lot from her after that, whether we want it or not..."
"7","POSITIVE","Otherworldly! The whole programme is aimed at destroying prosperity and creating unemployment.
Well, if this country is no longer worth living, the issue of economic migration has settled!
A creative approach!"
"8","POSITIVE","After all we know today, the Greens only build on air castles and sand castles. NO ready-to-use eco-technology is capable of delivering the energy we need for electricity AND heating. This applies even to virtually priceless solutions. So we can't do without atom and fossil. At the same time, the Greens are pretending to be able to work climate neutral if we only build enough windmills and board panels from China here. Pure statistics. Of course, I can produce so much eco-electricity - which is not needed while it is produced - to brag about statically CO2 neutral. Time to make oneself honest and to stop throwing more and more money to the delight of international pension funds and counterparts for techniques that do not ensure basic load supply and thus are actually useless for an (still) industrialized country. An English politician once said that in politics there are lies, damned lies and statistics. That's where we landed. Unfortunately, large parts of the population - fired by the media - have fallen into a quasi religious eco-rush. Awakening will come and hurt properly."
"9","NEUTRAL","At a party congress of the Greens, the Dunning Kruger effect is shown in its strongest form."
"10","NEGATIVE","Many demands are so extreme that I would speak of “Fridays For NO Future”.
No industrialized country can exist completely without U, world infiltion,"
"11","NEUTRAL","Change apartments according to your own taste? Are you still okay? Will this be a kind of concealment tactic for the tenants, that their landlord no longer knows who is where and, if necessary, it cannot be terminated? If I don't know where Person X lives, I can't send a rent increase or cancellation or just an info. This, of course, corresponds to the red-red-green concept."
"12","NEUTRAL","Thuringia predicts 22% (media)
Result 6.8% (Official)"
"13","NEUTRAL","Um, I'm sure I'm not a green voter. But, of course, your media figures were not current. Can you give the institute a date where this was calculated before the election for Thuringia?"
"14","NEUTRAL","“In addition to the minimum wage, there should also be a minimum fee for the self-employed. “

As a self-employed person, at the best will, I can't pay off more than what remains after deduction of all costs... What's the use of a minimum fee? 

Absurd suggestion!"
"15","MIXED","I am not at all willing to finance unsuccessful self-employment (especially since criminals can and probably will exploit such a thing).
It is better to think about tax relief for more or less successful self-employed workers! But the Greens want to be on everything and still consider themselves liberal."
"16","NEGATIVE","It creeps you when you read this post. Cynicism and schizophrenia are all in one to hear the real-world energy industry by wind turbines from environmental friends and protesters. And the party congress is clapping, the media are cheering. Does anyone else understand that?"
"17","POSITIVE","I think it is good that WO is also giving up - mostly - critical voices here, which speaks for this media lighthouse. 
Nevertheless, I remember the past few months, in which the Greens were repeated and written up several times a day. That bothered me a lot back then. Also applies to WHO, which I just happened to catch on TV the other day: Every day a journalist falls in love with Robert H.

Dear WHERE, I think it is time to report on these unspeakably unrealistic green dreams and their fatal effects on the economy, jobs and the population actually working and keeping this state running, and the need to address the real problems of the To take care of mankind, such as overpopulation, support of the so-called Third World in solving its own problems on the ground, the fight against the causes of escape andandand. Such coverage would require courage and backbone - and that's what you have at WHO, right?"
"18","NEGATIVE","With the accepted request of our dear friend Claudia Roth, are now, in a seizure of power of the Greens (can you say that?) , the door and gate opened to tens of millions of people who will receive asylum as climate refugees. At the latest, I realize that our country will go down with the help of the Greens - I fear they will make it."
"19","NEUTRAL","And in Austria they are soon part of the government."
"20","NEGATIVE","There is certainly an unmanageable number of aspects on which the Greens should be rejected for reasons of reason. I just want to refer to one important point - Germany is our fatherland. This means that the Greens, and especially their chairman Habeck, have nothing but nothing to do with them. All those who care that our beautiful German fatherland remains home to the Germans should do everything in their power to prevent the Green Party from becoming a ruling party."
"21","POSITIVE","Well, if a mental figure like Mrs Baerbock (see Goblins and Storing Electricity in the Net, that's all:)) is re-elected with 97.1 percent, then it cannot be far from education among the Greens. You have to assume that there are no smarter minds when choosing something like that. But this is also seen in Bavaria with Katharina Schulze. Nevertheless, thanks for the insight."
"22","NEGATIVE","According to our climate policy, we will import all products, steel, aluminium processing, copper processing, etc. which we no longer produce because of too high CO2 emmisions or too high electricity consumption, because the rest of the world does not have our requirements.
The Green Programme is a job destruction programme.
The shift of production to the Eastern European countries is in full swing.
The question of how much the world climate is falling when Germany has its climate policy
For 10 years, science and journalism are bypassed and excluded.
The German taxpayer must enforce his right to a cost-benefit analysis.
Where is the Confederation of Taxpayers?"
"23","NEUTRAL","@Hans B. 
UvDL has introduced a CO2 tax for the EU. Then it would work because you can only sell to the EU if CO2 has been reduced."
"24","NEGATIVE","If this really happens, that the green will rule in Germany, I'm curious how that will turn out. Can these people be let go of China, Russia and the United States?"
"25","NEUTRAL","A speech was also that the speaker called on green young people to learn building crafts, study architecture. The reason was that it is not enough for green politics to take only administrative professions, teaching professions and social professions. The speaker was right. However, it was forgotten to mention that the green offspring should also be enthusiastic about the MINT professions. In such professions, in addition to a solid training, which is often in demand by the national economy, one can also learn knowledge about the technical feasibility of ideas. Maybe that's not what you want. Too much knowledge of feasibility would not be very useful to “green dreams” and probably even contradict their ideology. But in this way, it will not be possible to secure majorities in the electoral citizenship in the longer term. The 'Greens' will continue to be untrusted by the majority of citizens of rationality and economic competence."
"26","NEGATIVE","Completely unselectable. Refugees, energy, minimum wage,... There are so many reasons not to vote for this party to rubbing your eyes in disbelief when you see its election results."
"27","MIXED","Not the election results, but the polls. Whether these correspond to reality remains questionable. The majority of protest voters in the European elections were certainly protest voters who ensured the high result. However, this will be thoroughly relativised in the near future."
"28","POSITIVE","The fact that Claudia Roth uses the word “home” is amazing. Even if it did not refer it directly to Germany, because it has so far expressed its negative views on this country."
"29","NEUTRAL","Other people “home”"
"30","NEUTRAL","If Mrs Roth says that 30 million people are already on the run as a result of climate change and justify this international asylum law, but does not want to bring everyone to Europe, it could be assumed that at least a large part can come to Germany.
This will eliminate further discussions about Germany's perspectives.
Perhaps some Green voters should think about Mrs Roth's statement alone before making the cross with this party."
"31","NEUTRAL","Radical political positions and nationwide leadership...
that does not justify the fact that the Greens are also suitable to be involved in a government, let alone to put the chancellor..."
"32","NEUTRAL","The same thing that is often accused of the AfD is also true of the Greens. Just because certain wings do not seem to have majorities does not necessarily mean that you do not get majorities when you are in power/government positions."
"33","POSITIVE","Now three days of non-stop live coverage of the Greens! This grandiose party, which so far has not taken Germany one step further.

What does the WON get?"
"34","NEUTRAL","I assume that an AFD party congress would also have been reported nonstop. However, with a slightly more smuffisant undertone and with the focus on every small comma."
"35","NEGATIVE","I would call it framing if this party is repeatedly tried to portray as left-liberal (actually an oxymoron). They act simply with post-communist approaches coupled with little expertise. Her unreal dream of covering the European energy market with renewable energies alone testifies to so much scientific ignorance that one wonders why the media are not seriously questioning. Btw, someone with knowledge of the state budget should explain why a debt brake is necessary and that a lot of money is currently being burned for rather nonsensical “projects”."
"36","NEGATIVE","Who really came seriously with the idea that the Greens are somehow liberal and centered? At the moment it is about a political fig leaf before the next election, the left wing of them is the most authoritarian and such a dystopian collection of people when it comes to political decisions that you can really be dumby on the basis of the poll values. In any case, the rapidly rising prices, especially for people with smaller incomes, caused by the Greens in the event of their participation in the government, also show that these are a cult of people who see themselves as above society and who, moreover, are completely unrealistic ideas , what everyday life looks like for most of the population. In the end, the recurring statements that “for the climate” can also be rather sharp interference with the individual's personal freedom is even worse than the total loss of social and economic policy"
"37","POSITIVE","Full agreement with their remarks. 
Also approval for the article by the author Mr. Ansgar Graw. I did this to me yesterday in front of the press club about 2 h, and watched at Phoenix at the “Greens” during their discussion. Among other things, it is surprising that the trade unions (Mr Sommer) are now apparently very well regarded among the “Greens”. So the question arises, what interests do they represent? Mr Sommer should actually represent the majority of AN's interests. And I don't think they'll be green. As a private person, he can, of course, do what he wants, but in my opinion, he should have declared it as a guest speaker."
"38","NEUTRAL","Today we import unmasses oil every day by oil tanker from all over the world and often not exactly democratic countries. One third of the world's total freight transport is oil. What would be the problem of importing electricity from North Africa? Wind power in Germany obviously has its limits, the sun in the Sahara does not. There the sun shines 360 days a year. Making it transportable gas is not a problem. Then you are also independent of day and night themes and can store it in the existing gas storage and as a reserve. Why hasn't it been done so far? Because someone would have to pay it and reduce the return. Oh yes, you can no longer sell your old power plants as an emergency reserve expensive. That's why the storage was forgotten."
"39","NEGATIVE","Because there are no stable political structures in Africa in which money can be safely invested. That's why the Desertec project (exactly its proposal) was put on hold years ago."
"40","NEUTRAL","It should gradually become clear that green policy is nothing more than a close-up and an anti-economic increase in costs. Although Greens believe that they acted on an international claim by trying to save the climate, they ignore the international economic consequences of their demands. Particularly piquant is the irrational assessment of nuclear power! In the meantime, it should be clear to everyone that nuclear power supplies the energy that produces the lowest CO2 emissions. Leaving this advantage to foreign countries, while you want to put more and more windmills in the countryside at home and want to drive CO2 pricing to dizzying heights is greedy and deceptive. Even though green thinking has allegedly arrived in the middle, I believe that the demands of the Greens, if they are to be enforced by national alone, will result in the new centre awakening from a nightmare."
"41","NEGATIVE","Yeah, but apparently the middle has to. Otherwise, it won't be. It has to crash before normal can come back. Unfortunately, people often become wise only out of damage."
"42","NEUTRAL","“At the end of the party day, Claudia Roth pitched the lectern to point out the consequences of climate change, including the “immeasurable loss of home”. “

So where she's right, she's right. I'm just afraid she means it differently than I understand and has been here for years."
"43","NEGATIVE","It is not only the extremely left and short-sighted content that irritates, but also the election result for Mrs Baerbock. Her mimicry seems to me as evidently arrogant as it is then verbally. Probably, this result comes about because the delegates consider themselves a kind of elite, elect. There is no other way to explain. 
The green ignorance, which prevents it from recognizing realities as such, is therefore to be regarded as secured by personnel according to Roth and Co."
"44","NEUTRAL","How many balls of ice is this time?
Although ice is now getting cheaper - at least in winter, when the so-called energy transition becomes reality!
Faithful Professor Sinn:” Energiewende Into Nowhere! “
The words of Habeck regarding the purchase of energy from other EU countries are already the beginning of the admission of one's own misassessment!
There would be much more to say, but nuclear energy will “save the people's butt “, and this is actually saying it all!"
"45","POSITIVE","Seriously: I am delighted every time Ansgar Graw reports on a topic relating to the Greens, because then you can get a detailed, knowledgeable and - from individual apt (!) rhetorical “peaks” apart - expect objective representation.

Joking: To experience a duo Ansgar Graw/Tina Hassel (ZDF) on a election evening - that would be a “megaevent” (https://www.tichyseinblick.de/feuilleton/medien/tina-hassel-beim-gruenen-parteitag-applaus-fuer-habeck/)."
"46","MIXED","Wow.. the green Schlaraffenland of the luck-soulful ecofreaks... how about completely renouncing electricity... everyone grows his vegetables and fruits themselves... no one goes to work anymore and meat is forbidden... a climate-neutral dtl. in which then only the eco-freaks live well and enjoy... so chooses green..."
"47","NEUTRAL","The Greens have not changed - it is the same spooking prohibition party only the party chairmen are better dressed and have found a hairdresser. The left remain in the background but continue to set the tone. Exchange apartments without changing the contracts with the landlord? Are there lawyers in this party? Clearly, they want another Germany, and also the market economy to make that even the market economy. Nothing, but nothing about this party is liberal. Finally Claudia Roth - who now wants to accept climate refugees via the right of asylum. I wonder how the CDU/CSU can recognize a coalition partner in the Greens - in this constellation, its voters are likely to look for another party before the election, which the interests of constituents of the Union have so much to do with those of that party."
"48","POSITIVE","It's half as wild with these greens. Probably better for 1.5 legislative periods than this Union, which is so broken that you can't look at it anymore. Robert Habeck is a realo with a pretty woman on the green side. Both are photogenic and will be able to bind a lot of voices in the long run. 

One saw Robert's relative braking efforts towards the Green-savages, the reasonably feasible in view. As BK, he would be such a kind of Joschka Kretschmann, thus most likely more leader and progressive than Angela Merkel with her halted union. 

If, contrary to expectations, the savages take the lead in the Greens, they disassemble faster than the CDUSPDFDP. Then Ulf Poschardt should take over! Let's look for a beautiful woman at his political side.;)"
"49","NEUTRAL","Baerbock, by name, pretty? Well, I don't know... 20 years ago maybe"
"50","NEUTRAL","“Dare more to risk nothing “says in the article, be the motto of the party day. Sounds absurd, doesn't it? That's not what it said, but: “Dare more to risk not all.” You have to think about it, but it makes sense. Note: Anyone who can read is clearly in the advantage - even when writing. 
Where did they go, the blessed times when someone else read correction on reputable media..."
"51","NEUTRAL","The councils, that is, the staff/works councils need to be strengthened and that should be done on a flat basis by incorporating them into any corporate personnel decision?

This is how sustainable left-wing policy will look in the future. A lever for securing the “right” medium to long-term “entrepreneurial” decisions.

In addition, the Personal/Works Council already has a considerable say today.
Which is quite right. 

But, a company belongs to the owner (s) and not to the staff/works councils. Among other things, strategic personnel policy related to the filling of central positions is a right of the entrepreneur. Otherwise, he can slowly frame his property rights and hang on the wall. They are no longer suitable for more than an exhibition, since his entrepreneurial freedom is ultimately only waste. 

But again a clever suggestion of left-green. 
The only thing missing is that the Councils should be elected from the citizens by lot procedure. Whoever forms this population from a left-green point of view in the future. Probably only “morally” unscolded citizens."
"52","NEGATIVE","I guess, in the case of a lot procedure (free according to Mrs Rackete, C.) certainly not the entire citizenship is provided for. I suppose she meant a pool."
"53","NEGATIVE","For me, “Left-liberal” is as furious and senseless as “right-liberal”. At best, a good voter bait for the voters of the political centre, when they were still there!"
"54","NEUTRAL","There was nothing left of a minimum wage of 12.-€, given rising energy costs. Taxes would also increase for these workers. But in the spirit of Mrs Roth, the money is also urgently needed to provide adequate care for climate refugees."
"55","NEUTRAL","Modern discharge by means of CO 2 tax. It's Gaga."
"56","NEUTRAL","There is no liberal left.
Either left or liberal."
"57","NEUTRAL","Hopefully, all Green voters read this and similar article, so that they also know what will come to us, that party should coalise."
"58","NEGATIVE","Will you stop the nonsense term “left-liberal “?
There's no such thing.
It's like infertility pregnancy."
"59","NEUTRAL","Now the New Green Deal have the Greens from the U.S.
Democrats around Bernie Sanders and Alexandra Ocasio-
Cortez stole. Works only with a Modern Monetary
Theory (MMT). 
Germany seems ripe for this."
"60","NEGATIVE","And they, in turn, looked at the essential element of this deal, the “green” energy supply, from the Schröder government. However, since everyone here can see the poor results that the high expectations of the EEG has brought to date despite almost biblical financial expenses, the chances of imitating this economic harakiri in other countries are close to zero. This green balloon is also based on fundamental misassumptions."
"61","NEUTRAL","One can only hope that the moderates will prevail around Habeck and not the supporters of FfF.
None of these radical climate supporters are concerned about who will pay these partly utopian CO2 prices and where the money will come from. It would also be interesting to find out what will be financed by the billions of income from the CO” tax and the motor vehicle tax.
The touching Christmas fairy of the Greens that these revenues will be refunded to the citizens is just as credible as the repayment of the Solis."
"62","NEGATIVE","The naive Friday for Future children don't understand that mom and dad are losing their jobs because the German economy is no longer competitive with all green measures. Then there is no smartphone or holiday anymore. 
There has never been a simple solution to complex problems. In addition, Mrs Roth wants to bring the whole Third World into the social system. You can't seriously want that?!"
"63","NEGATIVE","30 million people have lost their homes due to climate change and are waiting for rescue. And that's where you haggling about two-digit amounts in the CO2 pricing???

Soon I will lose my faith in our future government.
😨"
"64","NEGATIVE","It is already beginning that the voices in the enlarged circle of acquaintances become quieter, who, even a year ago, liked to emphasize, that - in their own view - the progressive and liberal new green. A little more time will pass and suddenly hardly anyone will ever have made his cross there."
"65","POSITIVE","In my personal environment, I often notice the green, no more than the new hope is seen.
As soon as people arrive in real working life, some opinions and views change.
Other topics are considered.
Anyone can ask themselves. How much does the optics play a role?
Even if unconsciously.
Humans are eye animals!
The team Baerbock/Habeck is coming over super. Dreamballs!
But in politics, facts, knowledge and competence count."
"66","NEGATIVE","What should a “CO2 pricing” be? I only know about a new tax. And do we not even want to surprise Greta, who probably demands 180 euros (on whatever), and say 1,800? Just sick, the whole thing."
"67","POSITIVE","No, just a good deal for Greta's father. After all, he deals with exactly these certificates and you earn a little more at 180 euros than with these lappish 10 euros."
"68","NEGATIVE","In short, D finally needs a sensible government again and that is CDU/CSU/FDP, everything else does not help us any more, with much better staff."
"69","POSITIVE","The CDU? I like this humor!"
"70","NEGATIVE","Only bans and the event are dangerously reminiscent of communist regulation and planned economy. So the flight of the GREEN will soon be over. Prohibitions are not part of freedom. Prohibitions continue to restrict freedom, especially when it comes to politically motivated over-regulation. No one really needs a CO2 tax. In reality, this is a further subsidy and advantage of renewable energies."
"71","NEGATIVE","Left-liberal?
This is a contradiction; either left, or liberal.
Both can't be done!"
"72","NEUTRAL","What do the Greens say about their very likely coalition partner in the next government in person AKK, which wants to participate in war operations around the globe. Not to find a word on this topic."
"73","NEUTRAL","Mrs. Kramp Karrenbauer and her party do not want to participate in war missions around the globe."
"74","NEUTRAL","“centerpiece, left-liberal self-conception” - what kind of nonsense is that. 

Here, ecosocialist plans are drawn up by the GREEN and this is beautifully written as a new “centered, left-liberal self-conception”. 

What do these decisions on the patronage and education of citizens and massive interventions in the market economy have to do with liberal: “liberal is imposing few restrictions on individuals, supporting the individual's self-responsibility; liberal.”

I can only see from this text where everywhere a green government wants to restrict citizens' freedom, access to its property and income in order to enforce its own green ideological view of the world. 
Where are government regulations withdrawn from green decisions and created framework conditions to increase individual self-responsibility? One sees only a gigantic redistribution programme at the expense of personal responsibility and service providers in favour of those who contribute nothing or little to the community but are to live well by the welfare state."
"75","NEGATIVE","The Greens can only be chosen for people who either do not know their program or who do not care about the consequences for the people. Rarely have I read so much ambitious nonsense and heard that being driven by the FfF children is now really not a rational reaction. For me, this is nothing more than green-religious fanaticism. And the saying “Prohibitions belong to freedom” reminds me fatally of the GDR, where it was called “Freedom is insight into necessity”, which also established the Wall and the Stasi surveillance. A green dictatorship is the last thing Germany needs."
"76","NEUTRAL","“To be driven by the FfF children is really not a rational reaction”

In a way, it is. Voters of tomorrow. The Greens will need them very, very much."
"77","NEGATIVE","I already pay almost 300€ for the ton of CO2 emitted by my car today via taxes.

At some point money has to be earned, that the Greens are so happy to spend, sometime our hopsing children will have to pay back. From subsidies this will not go..."
"78","NEUTRAL","Anyone who still does not understand: who chooses green does not only support supposedly realos like Kretschmann, but also the entire doomsday prophets. This is similar to the Afd, where you somehow always choose people like Hoecke. As long as neither one nor the others break with their chaotes, they are far from the rule of law."
"79","NEUTRAL","Quote: Habeck had prevented a demand for legal extension of expropriation by means of a personal intervention. But as an Ultima Ratio they are supposed to be possible. 

extreme left attitudes packed in green cotton candy..."
"80","NEGATIVE","Even if one does not agree with the Greens in terms of content, one must unfortunately acknowledge envied, 
that their enthusiasm, their enthusiasm, the good mood they bring over is distinguished from the other “griesgram parties”! 
Habeck and Baerbock manage to sell themselves well, bring everything loose, flaky over! 
Much to talk and little to say!"
"81","NEUTRAL","Switzerland is currently discussing the increase in CO2 emissions from SFR 96 to SFR 210 per tonne. Could anyone from the forum here explain to the Swiss that they are ruining with it?"
"82","POSITIVE","They will then already notice... is perhaps not quite as bad as you can easily calculate CO2 neutral..."
"83","POSITIVE","Elfriede J is absolutely right, there is nothing to add... see below."
"84","NEUTRAL","Well, at least there is still the word “work” (that is, making a living with a tax share) in this party! :) Otherwise, the money seems to come from the outlet, sorry, from the “bank”!"
"85","NEUTRAL","Well, for sure: With the CO2 emission, we deindustialize and demobilize the country (finally you have the beating argument to enforce dreams cherished for decades). We will then accept 30 million “climate refugees”. 
And the media are going to cheer persians (can you still say that?)

We're just too good. Our prosperous urban population is likely to experience a few more surprises if the dreams of their favorite party come true."
"86","NEGATIVE","One would once again need a decent recession or a black Thursday, on which some have and lose well and the unemployed pay to shoot up... vll some then no longer cheer..."
"87","NEGATIVE","Guys, let's just give up comments on this comedian squad. That says more than always the same lyre."
"88","NEUTRAL","By the way, the 180.09 €also apply to local transport, because the equality law dictates, and the ECJ will write that to them already in the family register. Then the ride on the tram costs about 8,00€, nothing more with lau."
"89","NEGATIVE","Only when Germany is noticeably plundered for the population will the gullible voters return to reason."
"90","NEGATIVE","“Keep it up” is not reasonable in times of change."
"91","NEUTRAL","What must the green and now forbid to compensate for the man-made eruption of the volcano in Indonesia (remember: we are a model)? Or were there no people in the game? And how does this affect climate forecasts? Do the Greens go ahead with a hutem example and do not fly after the party congress has been informed in Bali for 14 days?"
"92","NEGATIVE","...” On the way to the socio-ecological market economy “... Planned economy should be better off!
In no other party, I fear such a great difference between propaganda and what they will actually implement - if we leave it. The greens feed chalk until they are in power and then they end up with market economy.
For its terribly short-sighted main clientele - the metropolitan bourgeoisie, this is no longer threatening. With indulgences, they believe they can continue as they were before. How naive!"
"93","NEUTRAL","As soon as each individual has to limit itself (and these are always the lower income groups and thus the big figures), even in Germany no 15 percent of the population will vote more green, and in Europe even less. In this respect, the demands of the Greens must be seen as typical unfeasible demands of a typical opposition party. Of course, the election results are also weather dependent. This is the fault of the Greens themselves, who argued with the weather of 2018, even though the climate is concerned. In addition, the Greens should have stopped at the latest when the teenagers began to fantasize about the extinction of humanity and the burning planet. There is the contrast, if one is to demonstrate bibberly against global warming, then it is too stark."
"94","NEGATIVE","“Evise” comes from delusion. Which clearly describes the phenomenon. There is neither a climate crisis nor a climate catastrophe, but a lot of people who want to ask us to pay."
"95","POSITIVE","I am looking forward to the next BTW just as I looked forward to the LTW in Thuringia. I can finally praise the demands of the Greens at the ballot box again."
"96","NEGATIVE","May the majority decide in the next election whether these crude thoughts become reality."
"97","NEUTRAL","“In the short term it would even have to be 180 euros to be at a level with the demands of Fridays for Future (FFF):”

It's like real life. Children also want more and more pocket money, as this is generated by their parents, they are not interested. They just want to celebrate their own party everything else they don't care."
"98","NEUTRAL","What measures have the Greens decided against the three major problems of humanity? Overpopulation, pollution of the seas and destruction of the rainforest?"
"99","NEUTRAL","What measures are planned is stated in the article at the very end “Climate change could create situations that correspond to persecution within the meaning of the Geneva Convention — and thus justify international asylum law”."
"100","NEGATIVE","Mrs Roth's apparently adopted proposal shows the complete remoteness of reality of this party thinking only in radical ideal dogmas. If all this should be done, it will pinch at every point of this expensive hodgepodge. The Greens gamble high, because as junior partners they could say goodbye to most cloud cuckoo homes. They want to be the strongest force, I think with this party congress they have overturned the screw."
"101","NEGATIVE","This is the party that deducted the population, whether fuel electricity or oil you don't need."
"102","NEGATIVE","War against Germany's economic future...

... that's what it boils down to.
Pricing is the unword of the year for me.

It is a question of introducing new, previously unknown, taxes to some considerable extent.

60€per ton of CO2 for fuel is happy. - Citizens in the country, commuters are heavily burdened.
60€ per ton of CO2 on oil and gas for heating - then hits twice happig in the sum.

The Greens have not saved a plan like electricity, calculated a commuter fee, and certainly no idea how agriculture will be able to implement the rules and prohibitions imposed on you.

The Berlin Greens eat a vegan sausage in Kreuzberg, slipping a soy latte with Fairtrade chocolate sprinkles and think:

“Go... and don't cost anybody anything”.

I'm not going to join this zenober.
