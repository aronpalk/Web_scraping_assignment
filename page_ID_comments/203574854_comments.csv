"1","NEGATIVE","#Tom B. The way I see the thing, but this only works when people are in the performance context. Those who live on their assets or the income of the partner, or those who still have a job (but in a dying industry), do not receive any support. This shows all the myopia of the current policy of the Jobcenters, which, of course, act on instructions from the Ministry. Furthermore, this is one thing at your discretion, and there is no legal claim."
"2","POSITIVE","Many people like the idea. Scholz gets the chance of a further education. Cleverly thought..."
"3","POSITIVE","I don't like Scholz, but here he has a meaningful idea. Anyone who has “stealthy” in youth gets a second chance. Job change. Much more useful than turning the minimum wage screw. At the age of 18, many do not know what they can or want to do for a job. At 30, that's clear. But there is no possibility to learn something else. In order to prevent abuse, a part could be granted as a loan. The height of a Spätbafög would also be dissuasive. Regular young students have less than a frittenbrater at MacDonalds. Therefore, abuse would be rather rare. Presumably, this will only be a pipe crap. Nahles also had a similar idea. Little resonance. The SPD main line is less education-oriented. In the last election campaign on the posters “Education must not cost anything except a little effort”. The focus is on -little-. Speak - the SPD voters do not like to learn. Nevertheless, no one should deconstruct the way. Who with 40 years for 4 years instead of 2000€only accepted 900 and after that stands better has earned respect."
"4","NEUTRAL","“can do a new vocational training even at the age of 41 or 52”
Then this is the direct march into the basic pension?
The ARGE had a 'Action 50+' some time ago, which did not really change the placement of well-trained jobseekers because they often did not fit into the work teams or the works council did not grant permission because younger workers were no longer given contracts.
The 52year-olds should probably be retrained because the 25-year-olds have not received an apprenticeship and have found their life goal as dropouts in Hartz4?
What do the big employers say about these ideas? Is this even feasible if every larger group is dismantling jobs and digitalization makes thousands unnecessary?
In any case, a 52 year old student does not fall into unemployment statistics..."
"5","NEUTRAL","Reduce unemployment rates on paper. Anyone who is involved in retraining is not unemployed. Money for the facade."
"6","NEUTRAL","I also got a great idea: How about a number of politicians taking a degree or an apprenticeship first. Because I don't feel like letting some unskilled people make rules that, due to ignorance and inability, spend millions of taxpayers' money on advisory firms."
"7","NEUTRAL","Politicians are just the faces of a party.

There is the scientific service of the Federal Government - equipped with experts from various disciplines. Why you don't ask there instead of using consulting firms doesn't seem to me."
"8","POSITIVE","The 52 year old is studying once again until retire- Great idea!"
"9","NEUTRAL","- Of course.

As long as he studies, he is not one of the unemployed in unemployment statistics"
"10","NEUTRAL","Mr Scholz thinks of his own future when the SPD stops hiding ministers and the number of well-paid deputies decreases"
"11","NEUTRAL","As backward as the CDU/CSU are at present, the SPD can demand anything
only threaten a bit with the end of the coalition, all SPD wishes are fulfilled marginally weakened."
"12","POSITIVE","It seems that it makes more sense to fund an education for a German over 50 years old than a 20-year-old wonder worker from 1001 nights when I look at the statistics like this."
"13","NEUTRAL","“Groko” wants to support newspaper publishers massively and we taxpayers have to pay it!
Whose bread I eat whose song I sing.
In the future, publishers are expected to receive up to 645 million euros in government subsidies secretly, quietly and quietly. This also places them on the chain of state grants
- media distant from the state are being marginalized.

The influence of opinion continues to take its course!"
"14","NEUTRAL","“no one who wants to study today or wants to start an apprenticeship must ask a clerk in an authority for permission”.

Aside spell of the SPD candidate. It's not about studying, it's about paying. According to the Civil Code, parents only have to pay an education once.

The taxpayer also has to pay only once. The regular age limit for Bafög is 30 years or 35 years for Master's programmes. It is a societal and developmental biologically sensible definition that everyone is only paid once by the taxpayer for a qualifying school education in their life phase of the best admission, if necessary, up to a degree of study. 

In many countries, even developed, there is not even this standard. 

The rules already in force for age exceptions in school education are sufficient. There is already no age limit for company training. Finally, it is necessary to find a training company that wants to take on such an old trainee.

The SPD candidate seems to have completely lost grip."
"15","NEUTRAL","Scholz demands legal entitlement to a second training course

An acquaintance, over 50 years old, was paid the second training, 3 years, without any credit from the Job-Center (and probably also unemployment benefit, i.e. more than Harz)

he is a freelance employee for the US law firm White & Case LLP in Berlin."
"16","NEUTRAL","A legal claim? NO, definitely not! Every day Scholz drives a new sow through the village. When will he finally be moved somewhere where you can't hear from him?"
"17","NEUTRAL","This compulsive equality in Germany can no longer be tolerated. Women and gender must necessarily be involved in all areas, now even in pure men's associations (sometimes carnival clubs, men's singing clubs, lodges and so on! With such superfluous policies aimed at certain clients, a politician, Mr Scholz, will certainly not be able to land with the voters."
"18","NEGATIVE","Too bad, Mr Scholz is already 61, too late for a second training."
"19","NEGATIVE","The employment office promotes retraining. That's why I don't understand the meaning."
"20","NEGATIVE","Retraining is only supported under certain conditions, for example, if you can no longer work in your profession because of health reasons or if you have not practiced the profession for many years."
"21","NEUTRAL","Scholz concrete training and tax offensive makes it clear that a possible chancellor candidate of the SPD is warming up here. Hopefully the opposition dreams of the SPD will soon see that too."
"22","NEGATIVE","In the comments I noticed that a large training target group is forgotten. There will be a large number of mothers 35+ back on the labor market in a few years after perennial baby break. You still have 25 years of professional life ahead of you or more.

From their own experience, such women are gladly hired by employers for a regular training place. The problem is that families often have zero understanding of this. Some help job has to come, because every euro counts and the bank account is empty. But as a nursing aid, you earn half as much as a nurse. 

If you really want to demand women instead of relying on refugees and other migrants (they get full financial support!) , an increase in such a case would be a good approach.

Germany has a small army of intelligent and ambitious medium-sized women who go to clean, store shelves in the supermarket, sweep away slaughter waste, etc. A total waste of resources.

Abiturates clean the toilet and illiterate study law. This is sooo German!"
"23","NEGATIVE","Scholz demands legal claim because you see how ridiculous the candidate is I was older than I started my 3 training and I did not need a legal claim for this! In my class someone was a repupil 54 years old and the oldest apprentice in Alte Pflege is Ernö Cserhalmi the oldest apprentice in Munich at the age of 80. Oh God what's going on with the SPD nothing more this has lost its base! Rapted politicians set the topics for tomorrow and don't even know the here and today as professional politicians! It's not just Kevin alone at home who's sure to put another one on it!"
"24","NEGATIVE","Mr Scholz calls for... but this is lapping in the last days before the election of the SPD presidency..."
"25","POSITIVE","This suggestion is really good! I have been wondering why one can only get Bafög under certain conditions from (I think) 30 years of age, which hardly anyone can present. This means that most people can only submit the Bafög initial application at the end of 29. Suppose someone starts a new degree at 35, then is at 40 Master's in a sought-after subject. He still has the opportunity to work 27 years until retirement. It's worth it! One who studied at 50 and was 55 Master would be able to do 12 years. We are an educational nation (or understand each other as such). Everywhere it is said that you have to be ready for further education all your life, because the age-independent Bafög absolutely needs it. It should also be borne in mind that an elderly person can make a better career choice than a 19-year-old who is formally slain by his possibilities, but has not yet recognized his talents and talents. Or perhaps has been pushed into an unloved profession by his overwhelming parents. Overall, this helps not only the state and society, but also the individual, which can achieve greater satisfaction and hold more mentally fit, as if they were doing the same all his life. I very much hope that this will be implemented quickly and I think that, if in doubt, it could still be reckoned for a third training course. We must not stare on education."
"26","NEUTRAL","If I remember correctly, restudents have been able to do what Scholz demands for a long time. What is new is that you simply do another training, whether it is necessary or not, does not matter, but the taxpayer is allowed to pay."
"27","NEUTRAL","Since every two years the retirement age is postponed upwards by two years, training could soon be worthwhile even at the age of 60. After all, we must get used to the idea of having to finance government spending until old age."
"28","NEUTRAL","In Germany there is freedom of contract. 

Anyone can conclude a training contract with an approved training organisation at any time. The contract becomes valid if it is registered with the competent chamber. 

This requires no permission from the Employment Agency, except for foreigners who do not yet have a work permit. 

So I wonder if Scholz has something better to do than spreading misinformation. As Minister of Finance, he should rather steal the fact that the unspeakable 50 billion post that is heavily burdened on our communities and social security funds will finally be dismantled by the repatriation of illegal immigrants."
"29","NEUTRAL","The SPD and the CDU missed the Babyboomer generation from 1965 to 73 and to perceive and expand their competences. Now the then unrespected generations sit in poorly paid occupations, which are immediately unnecessary and, due to the educational catastrophe advocated by both parties, poor educated younger generations do not bring the performance and willingness of effort that the Sandwich Generation provides. 
This is followed by visions of irresponsible financial politicians in the public. Yes, is Carnival again?"
"30","POSITIVE","I think the second vocational training is right. Many can no longer work in their old professions.
But as is the case with the SPD, everyone likes to take care of other departments for which they are not responsible. And what he wants to do with all the men's football clubs, I don't know if it works the way he imagines it."
"31","NEGATIVE","Right, it irritates me enormously every time we speak, for example, of a shortage of craftsmen or when it is said that the Federal Police do not find suitable applicants, but at the same time we have many people of older age who would be absolutely capable of taking these professions - if you let them!

But the economy wants the typical 20-year-old apprenticeship or university graduate with 15 years of professional experience - and there is no such thing. The economy must begin to systematically explore and exploit the potential that our labour market definitely offers, rather than complaining.

On their second point, I would like to point out that the withdrawal of charity will not meet football clubs until they are consistently opposed to female members. It should be clear that in a small football club that has only one men's team and no one can or wants to set up another team will come up with the idea of discontinuing the promotion. On the other hand, large clubs can also be obliged to promote football across genders, but that is already the case."
"32","NEUTRAL","To demand men's singing associations that these women must accept. Only a SPD politician can come to that."
"33","POSITIVE","No one asked for that. I hate to defend the SPD, but it bothers me enormously that misinformation is spread over and over again in comment columns and is also evaluated positively.

The focus here is on the restriction “without objective reason”. At a male singing club or a women's self-help group for breast cancer, there is a factual reason to make these clubs gender-specific. A carnival or shooter association, on the other hand, which refuses to accept women and justify this with “tradition”, must live with the fact that its tradition violates our basic law and must be overtaken. There are traditions that no longer fit into our present day (especially in the religious-extremist sphere no one will contradict it...) and such traditions can also be “controlled” by the state by taxes, because taxes also serve to control the behaviour of the population and not just the revenue of the state."
"34","POSITIVE","Exactly - do training again so that you earn more to pay for membership in the club."
"35","NEUTRAL","And then look for a job with 47 times, while
many establishments 50 year olds prefer to send early retirement!
Maybe learn politicians and then head to Brussels!"
"36","NEUTRAL","I thought Mr Scholz was the Minister of Finance. But if I look at what the man has been getting out of lately, it's probably more Minister for this and that and everything. It would be nice if the gentlemen in the ivory tower thought first and then look for the public."
"37","POSITIVE","Great!"
"38","NEUTRAL","Finally OS says what the SPD, CDU, etc are going to do:
With 40-45 years a professional re-set and then maybe retired with 80.
Then the pensions are finally secured!
Before that, however, there is a quota regime for all establishments around the late beginner.
to guarantee workplace."
"39","MIXED","Any participant in the discussion always manages to divert every topic, but also absolutely every topic back to the topic of “migration”. We could talk here about the increase in the price of peppers, and yet somebody would manage to throw the issue of migration into it.

But on the subject: it is about the fact that there are people who, at 40, can no longer work in their old profession for a variety of reasons (e.g. because it is no longer available (mining) or because of illness, they can no longer exercise it). Telling these people to only sweep roads because they do not have an economically usable conclusion can't really be their demand?!?

If, at the same time, the economy complains that there are no skilled workers at all, it becomes clear how absurd it is not to use the potential of older employers consistently.

The point in which I agree with you, I pay for professional changers. Here we have to get away from the absurd system of “seniority” and also recognise general work experience in tariff law, so that even the 40-year-old repupil does not start with the salary of a 19-year-old companion."
"40","MIXED","Basically a very good approach, but it does not fit at all to a paretei, which, despite ever longer life expectancy, would prefer to retire people at 55."
"41","NEGATIVE","Perhaps politicians should have a little sense of reality.

Anyone who undergoes a second education at 41 or 52 years of age will not have the chance to work in this newly learned profession.

On the one hand, much younger ones are available with this training, on the other hand, the corresponding professional practice is lacking in relation to old age.

Depending on the training, this will probably still be useful for practicing as a hobby."
"42","NEGATIVE","That wouldn't be wise! After all, we are increasingly shrinking as society ageing and will most likely never meet our needs for skilled workers through immigration. It is already the wrong decision to sift people because of their age. In the future, many companies will think about it. For older applicants often bring with them qualities that the younger ones still lack. This is not always the case, but it happens. And these applicants will then come out of training just like the boys. So they proved that they can keep up with the boys."
"43","POSITIVE","I think it's good to be able to start a second apprenticeship as well as a further qualification.
Especially in the social sphere, kindergarten, sometimes it does not work anymore. Since the professions are very sought on the market, there is no chance of continuing education. 
In other areas (office) you will not be hired. 
After many years, you have a lot of experience, which you could do well with further education.
Therefore, I think this option is very good.
Of course, this also applies to other professions, where you simply get fried at some point or are physically ill."
"44","POSITIVE","I would be in favour of granting Olaf Scholz a legal right to a second training course! Perhaps he can make himself economically useful as a roofer or tiler. In the case of Kevin Kühnert I am also of the opinion that one should first give the young man a training in the prospect!!!"
"45","NEUTRAL","Or as a volunteer refugee worker! Well, that's already. In Hamburg, a mass of houses with floor-to-ceiling windows would be built for the refugees. Now he's used up my taxpayers' money. Now he can work for free. There's enough reason to let him go. And then he knows how it's like to retire early with discounts."
"46","NEUTRAL","It would be better to have a right to further qualification. 
Why change your profession when it's much easier to qualify people?

Instead of constantly producing new entrants, one should enable the trainees to continue training in their profession. From my point of view, this has a better perspective.

Unless you want to get people with poor/unrecognized education in mass and train them here at the expense of the taxpayers..."
"47","NEUTRAL","Certain occupations simply disappear with technical, social and economic change, or are thinned to a fraction of the jobs needed. This was not just during the days of the Weber uprisings, the Highland Clearances or the tractor's entry into agriculture. Here, I find new training opportunities rather than just short-breath retraining meaningful. Just one example: no matter how long bank employees continue to train, since the widespread spread spread of online banking, at best a quarter of the workforce in this sector is needed."
"48","NEGATIVE","Ha, legal right to a second training that I don't laugh.
On Friday we got the Bafög notification of our daughter for her first studies, result: 0.00 Euro Bafög, we supposedly earn too much. 
Not taking account of current expenditure into account, how can we do that?
I'm almost a single earner, my wife is sick in 2018 and now in unemployment benefits.
The state always demands education but rather supports idleness and misses the money for people who will never bring anything here. 
I'm through with this state."
"49","NEUTRAL","Scholz actually insists on trying to take action against men's clubs instead of clarifying that charity belongs to all clubs that are not open to everyone?
(These clubs can make jabzgl. membership nevertheless what they want, only without tax advantage.)
An unimaginable understanding of law emerges with the Lord."
"50","NEGATIVE","Now they are turning off completely - that this must then be financed by the company or taxpayer, Scholz simply presupposes. And probably there will be a “super-pensioner training law”, so that everyone can in any case realize themselves without being asked for anything...

The idea of weighing what our society actually needs and can do is certainly not come to mind for our Sozis. And that in the end it is our children who stay on the way with so much left daydreaming, probably neither..."
"51","NEGATIVE","Even at 80 you can still be a Santa Claus
have to be trained. With a bit of luck you have then enmal
one job or two, provided that the crate is still
is not ready!"
"52","NEUTRAL","I have two apprenticeships, you've always been right, haven't you?"
"53","NEUTRAL","Yes, but certainly not in the SPD."
"54","POSITIVE","The proposal sounds quite good at first, but I am skeptical about whether in the end it will not again be a barrel without a bottom. It would be useful for people who have already completed training and have better chances in another job. But as it always happens here, in the end the whole is puffed up without end and with the reference to human rights, equal treatment, etc., it becomes a universal, unlimited right to bafögfunded training without limit. Especially clever then start one training after another without ever finishing one and always get beautiful Bafög, because that is - as far as I know - higher than H4."
"55","NEGATIVE","Sure, that doesn't pay for itself.
The subsidies for an apprenticeship are higher than the taxes generated at the end of the apprenticeship until retirement. Especially with these low wages...
This is just another creation of black holes for German taxpayers' money"
"56","NEUTRAL","Scholz and the SPD can only be selected for me if the civil servants pensions are adjusted to the statutory pension, as in Austria, and also civil servants and politicians as well as millionaires pay into social systems."
"57","POSITIVE","Great idea Olaf, then do something else."
"58","POSITIVE","Class Suggestion:)"
"59","NEUTRAL","More importantly, I would find a “legal right” of the Solidarity Community, which obliges all under30-year-olds to pay for social benefits 
a) to make a qualified school diploma (if not yet available) 
(b) to complete an initial training. 

For all 30-year-olds, I would send social benefits to 
a) non-profit work
b) Continuing training
c) retraining/secondary training (if the original occupational profile cannot be pursued for understandable reasons or if there are very poor opportunities for placement)
knock it up. 

All this nonsense of “right to” is socialism, because no state can force employers to employ lazy bones, unteachable and evil choleric people. “Right to” means, however, that companies must also employ every offered employee - which is sometimes simply unreasonable and, moreover, contradicts the freedom of contract guaranteed by the law."
"60","NEUTRAL","A “right to” must also impose a “duty to”."
"61","POSITIVE","Supi, then many politicians could finally start their first training!"
"62","NEUTRAL","@Caissa, such as Mrs. Sarah Wiener (successful TV cook), currently member of the European Parliament. Mrs. Wiener doesn't even have a high school diploma, because she dropped out of school at 16. But there's no education without a high school diploma. Anyway, that used to be."
"63","NEGATIVE","Read and not understood, sorry. Maybe an example. I myself lost my job at 50 because of health reasons. Then had an idea. It followed assessments, tests, some rather dull, e.g. entering data into Excel for a day (ability to concentrate), psychological assessment, motives etc. Subsequently a report, the funds were released, then three years of training (accustomed to boarding school, was funny), with 54 state exams, job searched and on. Well, that went according to part-habelegislation, and some luck was part of it. But I know others of my age who retrain independently. And yes, you have to work with clerks. And yes, the choice is limited, here you could start. What does Mr Scholz want? Legal entitlement, subject to conditions or not, if so, to which? Well, if unconditionally, that would be cool. Then I study something with media again, apply for BAföG and get a good night's sleep.
When I hear politicians these days, I basically think of two ways:
First of all, not very likely, but not completely ruled out: They have an app that gives the hint in the morning, but please say something today. Then the random generator is activated and it appears e.g. Soz. Justice, women, gender, rents, education, digitalization, etc.
Secondly, my cognitive abilities are not sufficient to understand politics. I can live with this, because nowadays this lack of behavior, respect, morality, discourse ability, etc. can be subsumed under “diversity”. 
Hakuna matata."
"64","NEUTRAL","Scholz calls for the second step (second vocational training) before the first (first of all successful completion of the first vocational training). And in order to successfully take the first step, there is still enough to do in Germany, but it is not tackled strictly, this topic. You just get a look at our schools and our school system."
"65","NEUTRAL","All these legal claims sound nice at first, but lead to fewer and fewer apprenticeships being offered, see minimum wage for trainees.
On the one hand, Hartz IV lets the unemployed fall into nowhere, 14 years have been sanctioned cheerfully, on the other hand, the labour market is becoming more and more bureaucratized at the level above.
A three-year apprenticeship for a 52 year old is hardly worth it, because his chances at 55 in the labour market are very bad, unfortunately. The pension at 63 has also sent many well-trained professionals to retire. However, many companies replace them with less than 25 years old, who are able to pay less, as well as temporary and temporary workers."
"66","NEUTRAL","There are only two fundamental rights: the right to property and integrity. All other pseudo-rights can only be granted by violating the two fundamental rights of a human being. Most often, of course, the right to property, but also the integrity, because ultimately, you have to force someone to make this second training place available. 

Right to this, right to that, etc. that is basically immoral!"
"67","POSITIVE","Sounds kind of obvious to me. Well summarized!"
"68","POSITIVE","A very reasonable, correct and sustainable approach. 

Those who want to be even more reasonable, already at the age of 16 to 30 think about which profession is crisis-proof and irreplaceable. 

Because about such statements:

“Technological change is greatly changing occupational fields and no one can be sure that their job will still be available in 15 or 20 years,” said Scholz” (end of quotation)

Doctors, nurses, craftsmen and teachers in this century can only smile."
"69","NEGATIVE","This is open to anyone who wants anyway. So an air bubble from Scholz."
"70","NEUTRAL","“Scholz demands legal entitlement to a second training course”
Before a legal right to a second training is required, it would be advisable for some politicians to start the first training, or to bring it to a degree, and then to work in the profession, that will certainly change the “view”."
"71","NEUTRAL","I was not aware of the fact that only one training is allowed. Students are allowed to study something and as long as they want (with follow-up utilization in the Bundestag). And those who later felt called had free rein. Just had to limit itself. And I'm sure that's going to be at taxpayer's expense..."
"72","NEUTRAL","Aha, there's another coke in the toilet in the Bundestag."
"73","NEUTRAL","Does he mean himself?
I mean, you can assume that sejbe party is no longer involved in the GroKo for long and he has to think about what he should do afterwards..."
"74","NEGATIVE","Mr Scholz and his proposals, something like this already exists and is called retraining."
"75","NEUTRAL","However, retraining can only be granted if the employee is unable to work in his or her profession. This is about the fact that people who have learned a profession with poor labour market forecast have the chance to retrain. In principle, of course, everyone has a right to undergo a second vocational training, but people of advanced age have the problem that the apprenticeship wage is not enough to feed a family."
"76","NEUTRAL","Even now everyone can do an apprenticeship even at the age of 40. He only needs to find a training company. And those who are unable to practise their profession for health reasons will receive the retraining paid by ARGE. This also applies to people with professions for whom there is no use anymore. Regardless of this, funding is also possible through the ESF. Thus, the Scholz idea is again populism."
"77","POSITIVE","Best the Scholz does another training, it can only get better!

To my knowledge, the unemployed are entitled to further training or retraining as far as promising.
And otherwise, everyone can do a second training if they like!
Mr Scholz is once again only about state money which is paying for it and not about an allegedly non-existent right!"
"78","POSITIVE","@Sabine B., Mr. Scholz is a lawyer and is admitted to the bar. He is better educated than many of his colleagues in government. But I believe that Mr Scholz is concerned with redirecting the costs that the federal government has paid so far (Federal Employment Agency) to the federal states and municipalities. They are responsible for training. It is therefore a clever move. He kills two birds with one stone: media attention (who can be against a second training) and cost reduction in the federal government. Not bad, says the woodpecker."
"79","NEUTRAL","With Scholz, the SPD will certainly be able to achieve the 10%."
"80","NEUTRAL","Everyone can do as many training as he wants. The only question remains, who should pay for it...?"
"81","NEUTRAL","“Only the question remains, who should pay it...?”

During an apprenticeship there is an apprenticeship allowance if it is not enough, you just have to do a second job."
"82","POSITIVE","For a long time, finally, a sensible idea from the SPD. All attention, but we still work."
"83","NEUTRAL","It makes sense for over 50 years old. The voters and supporters are themselves like the SPD. At the end."
"84","NEUTRAL","Why do a 2 training if you no longer get a job from 35 years. You may end up in the Harztz4 industry, including low wage, made by SPD! 

Agenda 2010 = Poverty by Law"
"85","POSITIVE","Actually, a real approach!"
"86","NEGATIVE","That's a good idea. Right now, in the restructuring of e-mobility, this would be urgently needed. But until this is implemented, I'm already above the age limit. So I continue to develop diesel engines until it can no longer work and try to negotiate a maximum severance. The rest is paid by the state."
"87","NEGATIVE","Legal entitlement to a second vocational training, what kind of fog throwing is that? That's really a luxury problem."
"88","NEUTRAL","No, no, Mr Scholz transfers the costs of training the U30 new entrants to the Länder and municipalities. Clever, then he'll have more money in his budget, for other benefits."
"89","NEUTRAL","If people are to work up to 67 years or more, this is the logical consequence. The second training is already in place and is actually useful, why should someone who is not able to carry out his profession, such as a lawyer's assistant, for example, because the boss prefers to recruit a younger woman as an assistant, not get the chance to learn, for example, an educator. A professional field where a lot of employees are currently being sought and mothers also have experiences that enable them to have a shorter training time."
"90","NEGATIVE","She can do that today if she wants. But many want to pay only when the state (general public) for it. This is where our problem lies! No longer be responsible for yourself. Sooo we get insanely far 😜"
"91","POSITIVE","Everyone is free to continue training. Without constant training and adaptation to the changed requirements in the learned profession, even changes in normal life, one is quickly on the siding. Retraining is also possible. Everything can only be done with effort and with the aid of state and urban services and private use. The will is crucial. Especially by 30 you should pull all registers in order to obtain a safe profession. Even in old age does not help complaining, but learning and relearning. Scholzvorstoß in the form not good. The state should cover school costs for, retraining with success. In the case of apprenticeship of older age, provided that the older apprentice takes place, the compensation between apprenticeship and wages are paid by the state."
"92","NEUTRAL","Should all members of the Bundestag have completed vocational training with professional experience."
"93","POSITIVE","Super super 👍"
"94","NEUTRAL","“Scholz demands legal entitlement to a second training course”

Does O.S. want to train? Would be very welcome. But please not at the expense of the taxpayers."
"95","NEGATIVE","Perhaps he would like to train himself in the area of finance and taxation. There are apparently deficits."
"96","NEGATIVE","Promising retraining measures for occupations that are sought are already financed by the Jobcenter with the money of taxpayers. Everything else is pastime and may the “second student” pay for himself."
"97","NEUTRAL","Mr Scholz, with pardon, but perhaps some Members of Parliament should just finish a first training or a first degree before we talk about 'the right to secondary training' in D... because we have no problems!"
"98","NEUTRAL","At least I demand a claim that does not cost me another tax money, but gives me tax relief."
"99","NEUTRAL","Citizens should “once again undertake a new vocational training at the age of 41 or 52 
can?
Removal of tax benefits for purely male associations??
And now it's coming
“We must struggle for the confidence of our society”
Germany has no other problems Mr. Scholz (SPD) or???
The SPD's confidence is “so” with U5 Mr. Scholz and I, as voters, am confident that
that's exactly what happens!"
"100","NEUTRAL","Very good! Then they send all members of the Bundestag who are without a profession. If you do this at once, the Bundestag will be 25% smaller."
"101","NEUTRAL","However, Mr. Scholz currently wants to make a profile at any cost. Who pays for this new gift?"
"102","NEUTRAL","Non-profit is not determined by the sex of the members of the association. And the will of the members to become a member is reason enough, I think."
"103","NEGATIVE","To GroKo, that's why I became an AFD voter. Commercial training. Later, as a 100% expert, switched to the warehouse of a chip manufacturer. Then there were operational dismissals (restructuring). Shortly before the dismissal came the offer yet PLEASE to stay, via a salary slave lender: 
- Assistant
- Minimum wage + bonus for experience
- 5 hours of extra work than before per week
- 5 days less annual leave

I'm so tired of your hypocrisy!!"
"104","NEGATIVE","Mr. Scholz from the SPD has nice ideas.
Education is generally the basis for a satisfactory life, which is the prerequisite for our generational system, he should propagate this. The level of education in Germany is falling. Migrants from non-educational countries flood schools and, of course, contribute to this. That is Mr Scholz's problem. 
Whether a 40 or 50 year old with a new apprenticeship, then also finding a job is still to be questioned.
The SPD constantly demands new “legal claims” for any special problem that fits into its “justice drawer”.
When does the SPD actually ask for something for all those working, tax-generating people whose wage is 50% of the state's revenues, when do you do something for the working population who have to pay all the nonsense?
Strengthening one's own strengths is the prerequisite for combating weaknesses, not the other way around. My opinion."
"105","NEUTRAL","Step 2 of the SPD will be that those unemployed who do not wish to benefit from this offer will be reduced. Firstly, occupational retirement provision was recommended to increase the pension. After almost 7 million contracts have been signed, retroactively (!) with 100% KV and PV contributions, the private pension is charged."
"106","NEUTRAL","The man has never worked, a second education or study they can always do when intellect and motivation are right. Scholz's legal claim goes the other way, according to the motto “I don't have a job, state sometimes, because state can't give me a job so quickly, I have the right to state support “."
"107","NEGATIVE","Jörg K. they didn't understand what Scholz meant by it. At the moment, not everyone can go and say I'm over 50ty can no longer work in my old profession I want to learn a new one. Because do you think someone at 50 and family could live off the training allowance?"
"108","NEGATIVE","Our politicians have failed to understand mistakes, or do not want to, but defend them up to the last, but to recognize mistakes means strength, everything else is stubborn weakness. Only that with the 2nd training seems to be a better idea, only who pays for it, the employers don't think they train too little now."
"109","NEUTRAL","Are these the real problems of the labour market? The employment policy? The education and training? Thank you, Mr. Scholz. Next, please!"
"110","NEGATIVE","Mr Scholz is looking at problems that hardly anyone has."
"111","NEUTRAL","On the new training: And how does that work? I have been working in my profession for 24 years, hopefully I can and will continue to do so. Now, if I think I want to study law, will I get it promoted? Not serious, is it? What can be done is to allow people who, due to the absence of the profession, no longer be able to practise their professions in a targeted way to access and learn professions that are needed. I spontaneously think of the need for care or the lack of craftsmen. Anything beyond this is more free beer for everyone.

And to the men's associations: the existence of charity should have nothing to do with sex admission. It should be strictly tied to the fulfillment of the charitable purpose. And if it is acknowledged that a miner's choir meets these criteria, then it is. Women's sports clubs and women's carnival clubs also do not allow men. So what? The left-oriented political forces should stop confusing equal opportunities with equality. Such approaches split more than they connect."
"112","NEUTRAL","Some politicians in the Bundestag do not even have an education yet, but think they are able to say anything about it."
"113","POSITIVE","That makes absolutely sense.
The change in working life is so fast today that many people will eventually have to retrain.
Good point that Scholz raises.
For that."
"114","NEUTRAL","Robotics and artificial intelligence will in any case completely transform our working world and thus also the social systems. In 15-20 years, only androids will work anyway. We need completely new concepts"
"115","NEUTRAL","If you don't believe in the androids and robots, please watch the following video on YouTube and think about the future for 15 years: https://youtu.be/_sBBaNYex3E
And then you think about Alexa and Siri 15 years further. Which company then needs expensive, sleepy and disease-susceptible flesh blood?"
"116","NEGATIVE","The idea of the right to a new professional quality in the
middle age is good, but should then affect all professions as well as study professions. Until now, only IHK occupations are available and they are only limited and there is no legal entitlement. Who from healthl. reasons have to reorient themselves, most of which is pushed into auxiliary jobs without quality."
"117","NEGATIVE","Heading wrong. It's probably more about the money for the second training. In distributing the money of others, the Sozis are good, with the election successes getting worse and worse."
"118","NEUTRAL","“It is about associations that consistently and deliberately do not allow women to join without any objective reason”. Scholz should row back, I mean.

The new magic word is now called “objective reason.” There are countless (hundreds) women's associations and women's networks in Germany that do not wish to receive male members (Frauenverein für Selfdefense, Deutscher Akademikerinnenbund, Hausfrauenbund Darmstadt, Afghanischer Frauenverein, Evangelischer Frauenverein Offenbach...). There will now have to be stipulated that they have a non-profit “objective reason” to accept only female persons. Even the term “women's association” is discriminatory in many cases."
"119","NEUTRAL","The commonality of men's associations seems to be the socially central theme of the future for the Social Democrats. Scholz recognized that. I look forward to the next elections."
"120","POSITIVE","Let us look at it from other ends, the vocational schools are not supported by the federal government. With an increase in the age of apprenticeship, Mr. Scholz assigns the training of the “newcomers” to the Länder and municipalities. His budget will be relieved. Does he have more space for other desires. Really clever. Nevertheless, I welcome the idea of only asking me who starts training again at 48, under the current framework conditions."
"121","POSITIVE","I am 49 years old and have 4 completed, state-recognized training courses and worked for several years in each profession. I am a hotspot and very flexible. It did not hurt me, on the contrary, it enriched my life. Financial was never the most important thing for me. Anyone who gathers experience in different areas is more open to new things!"
"122","POSITIVE","How long can such a Scholz last in the top, it's incredible. A second vocational training? Exactly and Schozl then presents the pretty certificate folders on a stage. It is already clear that our vocational training system is completely inflexible and therefore far too late. There is a need for a wide range of further training courses defined by the industry directly in companies."
"123","POSITIVE","This may also be an alternative for failed politicians who can finally learn another profession."
"124","NEUTRAL","100% my opinion."
"125","POSITIVE","Good idea! Do employers think that too? Are they ready to hire a fresh journeyman with 0 years of professional experience to a salary that a 40 year old then imagined?"
"126","NEUTRAL","In every industry there are entry-level salaries, and logically an older person enters on these terms. 
Always financially much better than living on ALG or Hartz 4."
"127","NEUTRAL","Do people finally know why to vote for the SPD because of Scholz's demands? I have my doubts. But maybe he scores with some gender activists because of his insanely important men's theme."
"128","NEUTRAL","Men's clubs, second training for Ü40: After all, the SPD has an unmistakable sense of the topics in order to finally reach below 5%. On the other hand, I do not expect anything from Scholz in view of the failure of the G20 in Hamburg."
"129","NEUTRAL","What else could we finance for the SPD at the expense of public budgets so that this party has better opportunities in future elections?
e.g. a week of vacation for every German citizen - paid by the taxpayer. That would be something for the SPD to finally get more support in the elections.

Of course, this has nothing to do with strengthening the individual's self-responsibility. But it is about the SPD and its' new 'voters."
"130","NEUTRAL",">>Citizens should “be able to do a new vocational training even at the age of 41 or 52,” says Federal Finance Minister Scholz. <<

A cool idea, and best of all, the professional politicians start to do a vocational training EVER AND complete it successfully. For me there are far too many post warmers who have brought exactly NIX in their entire career in normal occupations, and now keep a seat in the Bundestag warm for a bunch of money and make life difficult with their stupid ideas for the normal population.

For this reason, I would first ask for an apprenticeship for professional politicians:)

Does anyone seriously believe that a 50-year-old coal worker, whose job has fallen off because of the cessation of mining, in a 12-week course “sometimes by the way” retrains to “qualified nurse” in order to fill the gap in nurses?

Or, as it is suggested in another article, that in a “2-3 months bootcamp” you do “what with media” and suddenly get a highly endowed IT job as a demanded IT special? Why do the native ITlers need years of training or study if you can acquire the same knowledge in a 12 week Bootcamp?

To assume that you can train personnel for these defect professions in 12 weekdays is just as nonsense as to assume that you will become an IT expert by reading the “Computer Image” once. (of the latter unfortunately there are some)

And at the age of 50+, my coal worker, quoted above, will probably not have the motivation or physical capacity to do a 3+ year training in care and then work in such a bone job until his retirement (with the estimated age of 70+ if politics continues).

Then what is left as a job perspective for him? Bag packer at the Aldi?"
"131","NEUTRAL","The politicians are not born into the Bundestag nor are they civil servants there for life. They're all only sitting there for four years for a limited time. They can be out faster than they like."
